<p class='pindent'>It were much too vast a labor to commence an
inquiry into the subject of this essay, with a dissertation
on the <span class='it'>origin of music</span>. Posterity may be
enabled, by the aid of advanced wisdom, to explain
the birth of this and other blessings which to us appear
only natural, and may, perhaps, successfully
trace to their sources the numerous enjoyments which
God created as ministers to man’s happiness, and of
which we now know only the mere existence. It
will not be uninteresting to our children’s children to
learn how men first discovered that the various
sounds with which the Creator, in his wisdom, invested
the human voice, might be linked together in
wonderful combinations—producing from monotonous
particles melodious unisons; and how a knowledge
of the various distinctions which the extension
or diminution of time confers on every distinct atom
of sound, first dawned upon the human mind, appealing
through the senses to the soul, and binding, with
a force and power which belong not to any other immaterial
agent, the heart of man in chains of amaranthine
flowers. These wonders, like many more,
which now, for aught we know, lie on the first <a id='turn'></a>unturned
page of wisdom’s book, will one day be developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is more than probable that he who first tuned his
voice to song, little thought of the marvels of music,
nor dreamed to what perfection the rules of sound
would one day be brought. He used the power
which God had given him, nor stopped to inquire
into the nature or construction of the tones which he
almost involuntarily produced, and which lightened
his labor, while they made glad his heart. Science
in those days was an infant:—has she yet passed the
era of her first childhood?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A consideration of the history of music may be
prosecuted under four heads: Ancient and Modern,
Sacred and Profane; but as it is not intended to do
more in this essay than to indulge in a few unimportant
and rambling reflections on the progress of music,
and on the state of perfection to which it has at present
arrived, we will cursorily review ancient music,
as preceding the days of Handel and Mozart, and of
modern music, from those masters down to the
writers of the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not denied that the earlier attempts at song
were so limited in design and so feeble in imagination
as to excuse the application in our time of the
term <span class='it'>barbarous</span> to the music of the days of Moses
and Miriam, and even to the sounds which accompanied
the inspired language of the poet king. Music
was then in its infancy. The rude instruments which
Tubal Cain invented, and which in after ages were
improved, but still left rude, were circumscribed in
their compass, and harsh in their tones, although
reason teaches that they must have been, what is
technically termed “true” in their mechanical formation.
According to the compass of these rough
productions, the multitude restrained their compositions.
Instruments were considered necessary to
give effect to song; but as these auxiliaries could not
express all the sounds of which the voice was capable,
it was thought requisite that the voice should
be made subservient to the instruments. The more
extensive compass of the voice excited admiration
and stimulated the desire for imitation. Thus the
voice was the means of improving the mechanical
expression of sound; and as instrumental mechanism
progressed, the human voice became liberated from
the restrictions which former ignorance had imposed
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
upon it, and a freer course was afforded to its capabilities
in obedience to the eccentricities of the imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every nation has always had, as it now has, its
own peculiar and distinctive style of expressing emotion
through the agency of the voice. Barbarous as
the first developments of musical ability may have
been, they nevertheless expressed the peculiar and
characteristic feeling of the people who employed
them. With one nation the style was melancholy,
with another pensive, with another light, and with a
fourth lively. Some delighted to denote their ideas
in the junction of lengthened and monotonous sounds,
expressive of grief; others in short changing accents;
of carelessness or indifference; and others in the deep
measured sounds of martial melody. These distinctions
still exist in so marked a degree among different
people as to entitle them to the appellation of national
musical characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is generally believed, and not without good
grounds, that the earlier attempts at producing musical
effect by the union of a considerable number
of voices and instruments, were not remarkable for
any of that variety which invests with so many attractions
the music of a later period. All the singers
enunciated the same notes, and in the same time—very
much in the style which large prayer-meetings
adopt in the open air. The manner in which the
beauty and diversity of concords and discords were
first discovered, and the precise era at which such
discovery was made, are also matters which are reserved
for some later and more successful laborer.
This branch of the science of music has, perhaps,
undergone greater alteration and improvement than
any other. It is by no means an uninteresting study,
first to imagine the absence of all knowledge of
chords among the first inhabitants of our globe; then
to look over the works of the earliest masters whose
compositions are still extant, and then to follow the
publications of later writers down to the present day,
observing at each stage the wonderful differences
which exist in the instrumental writings of every
age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The act of committing sounds to paper, although
very old, must still be regarded, comparatively with
the birth of music, as of late discovery. Transferring
mere sound from the mind to the paper, without
the assistance of any intermediate articulation is a
wonder equally great, to say the least of it, as is the
act of writing words. Yet no one gives a thought to
the invention of the marvel. The fame of <span class='sc'>Cadmus</span>
is diffused over the habitable globe, while the mastermind
which first conceived the possibility of recording
his thoughts on and in a few parallel lines by
means of dots and scratches, causes no inquiry and
excites no admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of organizing and perfecting so complete
and infallible a scheme must have been immense.
In the first place the distance, so to speak, between
each tone of which the human voice is capable was
to be defined by certain laws and rules, and represented
by distinctive marks. Then the length or
duration of each tone in any given air was to be
marked separately or in junction with other tones,
without deranging the qualities of any or detracting
from the harmony of the whole. Then were to be
encountered the difficulties incidental to changes of
the key-note or tone. On discovering that the human
voice, after executing seven notes, among which are
five tones and two semitones, produced, in ascending
to the eighth, a tone exactly similar to the first,
it was necessary to construct a scale of keys which
would always place the two semitones in exactly the
same position, and in the same relation to the full
tones. Lastly, and perhaps more wonderful than all,
a proper and minute division of <span style='font-size:smaller'>TIME</span> was to be
effected. That inherent appreciation of what musicians
term “time,” which almost every human
being possesses naturally, but which few understand,
and none can explain, was to be expressed and defined.
Divisions and subdivisions were to be demonstrated
and made clear. This was the task of
tasks. Savages, who never heard of the existence
of such a science as music, are known to clap their
hands in unison at certain measurable periods in
their wild songs. They observe the law of musical
time, without having the slightest conception of
what time is. Nor are we much better now. We
can write time as well as tune, but we know not
now, nor have we yet been able to analyze or detect
the instinct which teaches us, as it does the Savages,
at what periods of any given air we should mark
time. Yet thousands of persons, singing together,
will “<span class='it'>beat</span>” at the same instant. No one knows
why or wherefore it should be so. We only feel
that it is so, and that human ingenuity has enabled
us to write and otherwise to mark time. The order
of intellect, which first discovered the means of
doing even this little, must have been very high
indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The difference between the musical instruments
of our time and those of a former age, is another interesting
subject of inquiry. The Bible mentions the
timbrel, the ram’s horn, the reed, the harp, silver
trumpets, and other equally rude inventions. From
later classical writers we learn the existence of the
pipe and tabor, the lyre, the lute, and others. In the
records of a much more advanced period, we find
mention of the harpsichord, whence we have obtained
our present tolerably perfect piano forte. The
gradations from the instrumental knowledge mentioned
in the Bible down to the astonishing state of
improvement to which the art of manufacturing
musical instruments has arrived, have been slow but
steady. It is possible that our posterity will look
back upon our piano fortes, our violins, violincellos,
double basses, cornets, trombones, bassoons, oboes,
clarionets, flageolets, flutes, harps, French-horns,
serpents, opheclides, guitars, tenors, and kettle-drums,
with great contempt. Perhaps even our
organ, which is an ancient invention, will not escape
the critical censure of a coming age. And there can
be little doubt that much remains yet to be known
in the manufacture of musical instruments. It may
be said with much reason that the only perfect instruments
now in use are the violin, the violincello,
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
the double-bass, the tenor, and one or two others. On
these any tone of which their compass is capable
can be produced in every possible variety of execution.
The piano forte, delightful as are its powers,
cannot produce a gliding sound from one note to the
other; neither can it prolong a note for any length of
time without losing at its termination the vigor with
which it produced the tone at its commencement.
In addition to these disadvantages it labors under
another which is common to all wind instruments.
It can produce full tones, diatonic semitones, and
chromatic semitones, but it cannot yield an enharmonic
tone. On the piano forte, on the harp, and on
all wind instruments, (with the exception of the
organ in the Temple Church, London,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a>) G flat is F
sharp; A flat is G sharp; E sharp is F natural; B
sharp is C natural; E flat is D sharp, and so on. The
difference is so nicely arranged as scarcely to strike
the finest ear; but it is undoubtedly an obstacle in the
way of perfection which will most probably be overcome
by and by. The organ in the Temple Church,
in London, which we have made an exception to
the above complaint, is a curious specimen. The
black notes are split, in order to provide for the production
of enharmonic tones, and the effect on a nice
ear is very agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the majority of organs are not made on the
last named principle they must be classed among the
imperfect instruments. At the same time, it is believed
that general opinion unites in ascribing to the
organ the first place among instruments. It is capable
of prolonging sounds, of producing multiplied
chords, of modulating and swelling its tones at the
option of the performer, of suppressing or expanding
its volume, and, in a word, of doing every thing
which any other instrument can perform, except of
gliding from one note to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are now extant several specimens of the
style of music in use among the monks of the earlier
Christian ages. These examples are very curious, and,
to the casual observer, extremely interesting. The
airs are written on four lines, and are marked with
treble and bass clefs, but they would appear to have
been intended almost entirely for the use of singers.
Instrumental music of that period is much more rare
and uncommon. The compositions alluded to are
very feeble, and evince an ignorance of the extent to
which musical sounds might be made available.
They are merely loose themes without any attempt
whatever at artistic effect. As time wore on, the
writing on five lines instead of on four became universally
adopted in Europe, and the style of composition
gradually improved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English nation have never been remarkable
for musical genius. As late in their history as the
accession of the house of Hanover, the greater part
of their music came from abroad. Nor were there
any great instrumental performers among them. It
is only of comparatively late years that any thing
like a talent for composition has sprung up among
them, and even now they are so far behind most other
nations in the art, as to hold a very insignificant position
in the musical world. While the music of
all other countries has in it something distinctively
and peculiarly characteristic, English melodies (if
we except their glees and madrigals) have none.
The late operas which have been brought out in
London, betray an attempt at servile imitation of the
Italian school; but the English have not a writer at
the present day whose compositions manifest the
slightest originality: and with the exception of Dr.
Arne, Cabott, Bishop, Rolf, Rooke, and one or two
others, their musical works are devoid of conception,
character, or beauty. At the same time it must be
admitted that there is nothing finer in the world than
the English glees and madrigals. These possess a
truly definitive character. They are really English,
and bear about the same relation to the smooth
strains of Italy and Germany, as the bluff, straight-forward
yeoman does to the French exquisite.
They are at once original, heart-stirring, and amusing.
Many of the madrigals exhibit a great amount
of artistic skill and musical acquirement, and, when
well executed, they are extremely entertaining. Some
of the English anthems are also very excellent, but
the attempt to imitate the German school is too apparent
throughout. They are not the less agreeable
on this account, but they lose the charm which
would attach to originality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English are, as a nation, fond of music, but
their love for it seldom reaches the enthusiasm which
is felt for the art by a German, an Italian, a Frenchman,
or a Spaniard. It would, perhaps, be more
correct to say that the English admire music rather
than that they love it. The uneducated classes will
gladly listen to music, but they are never moved by
it. They may learn or become acquainted with certain
airs, but they never impart to what they sing or
whistle that elegance or depth of feeling which a
really musical mind never fails to throw into an air
which pleases him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scotch music, without possessing much claim
to art, has a decidedly characteristic feature. It is
unlike the compositions of any other country. Even
their quickest airs have something peculiarly melancholy
in their style, which is touching and agreeable.
The principal feature in Scotch music is the frequent
introduction of short, catching sounds before
long notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Spanish style of music is pleasing but variable.
The national fondness for dancing appears to exercise
some influence over all their strains; notwithstanding
which many of their airs have an extremely
melancholy expression. As opera writers they have
never excelled, but for love-songs and martial
choruses, their style is equal to that of any other
people in the world. Their serenades are among
the sweetest efforts of simple composition in the
world, containing, notwithstanding the plainness of
their style, considerable feeling, and an obvious expression
of deep passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian school of music divides with the
German the admiration of the world. Differing
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
widely from the German, it possesses charms equally
attractive and quite as moving. If a preference is
to be accorded at all, it must be given to the German
school, which contains more art; this preference
could, however, only be yielded by musicians.
The masses are more likely to be attracted by sounds
which appeal at once to the senses and charm the ear,
than by strains which contain perhaps somewhat less
of melody, but which stir up the passions to a greater
degree and do not charm until they are understood.
The Italian style is smooth, soft and melodious. Even
the most martial or impassioned passages are harmonious
and agreeable. The chief dependence of
the composer for success would seem to be the
melody of the scene which he writes. The arrangement
is generally artistic, but only sufficiently so to
accord with the desire of the composer to make use
of the richer resources of his art. He makes the
science subservient to the principle of attraction.
For this reason Italian vocal music is highly preferred
before Italian instrumental music. While as
opera writers, the masters of Italy are deservedly
famous, we seldom hear of them as composers for
the piano, or of any lengthy romantic pieces in which
instruments are to convey certain impressions unaided
by the human voice or by personal representation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Italian composers who have remained favorites
until the present day, none, perhaps, assimilate
more closely to the German school than Pacini
and Mercadante. Their works cannot boast of that
melodious characteristic which so highly distinguishes
those of their fellow-countrymen, the theme
being generally less connected; but they are nevertheless
decidedly of a higher order in an artistic
point of view than the operas of their more favored
successors. In the lighter style of Italian composition,
Cimarosa and Ricci, as old masters, rank
deservedly high; but they do not bear comparison
with the Buffo school of the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the later writers of Italian operas who have
attained eminence in the divine science may be
named Mercadante, Rossini, Bellini, Donnizzetti,
and Verdi. To compare the peculiar merits of
these great artistes would be a task of extreme difficulty,
as Rossini, Bellini and Mercadante differ very
materially in style, while that of Bellini and Donnizzetti
closely assimilate, and Verdi’s partakes
of the character both of Bellini’s and Donnizzetti’s,
with something of the German school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style of Rossini, without being deficient in
feeling or artistic arrangement, always partakes in
some degree of lightness, which is owing to the very
florid manner in which he invariably wrote. His
Guiglielmo Tell, Pietro l’Eremita, Gazza Ladra,
Otello and Semiramide, are among his finest compositions.
The last named opera is decidedly his best
effort. Il Barbiere di Seviglia is a favorite with
many persons, but it cannot be said to contain many
brilliant examples of success. The “Una Voce”
and “La Colunnia,” are <span class='it'>the</span> attractions in the
“Barber.” The <span class='it'>role</span> of Figaro is a great source of
attraction to the lovers of Merry-Andrewisms, but
scarcely so to the musician. One of Rossini’s most
powerful compositions is the Stabat Mater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The style of Bellini, on the other hand, is totally
different from that of Rossini. Bellini is at once unaffected
and chaste. There is no seeking after applause
by introducing difficult passages requiring
great flexibility of intonation. Every air, every symphony,
every prelude and introduction appear to have
been written with the view to the expression of some
passion, or the demonstration of some feeling which
it was required to convey. It is deeply to be regretted
that so bright a genius, promising so brilliant
a future, should so early have been lost to the world.
During Bellini’s short but energetic career he produced
eight operas, every one of which will to this
day bear the most searching examination of the most
rigid critic:—Norma, Bianca e Fernando, I Puritani,
Il Pirata, La Straniera, I Montecchi ed i Capuletti,
La Sonnambula, and Beatrice di Tenda. Of these
his Puritani and his Norma stand pre-eminently great.
Next in rank are his Capuletti and Beatrice di Tenda;
then La Sonnambula, La Straniera, Il Pirata, and
Bianca e Fernando. The whole of Bellini’s writing
is marked by a tone of melancholy which at this day
seems like the foreshadowing of an early affliction.
He had, perhaps, in a greater degree than any other
author, the power of throwing into his airs an unmistakeable
interpretation of the passion or feeling which
was embodied in the language. The “Deh! tu, bell
Anima!” in Romeo e Giulietta, is one of the finest
specimens of the remarkable correctness with which
the words and music may be so blended as strictly to
accord in the expression for which they are intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Against Donnizzetti it has been argued that he
was a plagiarist; but when the number of operas
which he has written are taken into consideration,
the accusation will not bear weight or scrutiny. His
style is neither so flowing nor so scientific as that of
others, but his works are nevertheless highly meritorious,
being generally very melodious and expressive.
In the course of a long and famous life Donnizzetti
produced upward of seventy operas. Among
the best of these are his Lucia di Lamermoor, Belisario,
Pia de Tolomeo, Lucrezia Borgia, Torquato
Tasso, Fausta, Anna Bolena, Roberto Devereux,
Betly, Elisire d’Amoré, Linda di Chamouni, Il Burgomastro
di Saardam Favorita, and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Giuseppe Verdi is the latest composer of the
Italian school, and he <a id='prom'></a>promises to be one of its
brightest ornaments, when experience shall have
amended his faults and restrained him from those
bursts of too powerful effort which he delights to
exhibit, and which impart a strained character to his
works. There are many of the London Dilletanti
who affect to dislike Verdi; but the only reason
which can be given for the harsh criticism which is
dealt out with no sparing hand on the devoted head of
the young aspirant, is the habit which too often exists
in that city to despise modern talent to the exaltation
of the wisdom which is past and gone. The chief
beauty of Verdi’s writing is to be found in his moving
choruses and concerted pieces. These exhibit profound
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
musical knowledge combined with much
genius, great feeling, and frequently exquisite taste.
As examples of a happy union of these qualities,
may be instanced the chorus “<span class='it'>Il Maledetto non
ha fratello</span>,” in Nabuco; the terzetto, in Ernani; the
chorus of crusaders, in I Lombardi, and others.
His operas are Nino, Ernani, I Lombardi alla prima
Crocciata, I due Foscari, and Attila. Of these the
four first mentioned are unquestionably the best.
There are many other writers of great talent among
the Italians, but as they are little known to the world
a consideration of them may, perhaps, be deemed
prolix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the German school of music,
which, notwithstanding the vastness of the subject
comprehended in this title, will be treated with as
much brevity as will serve to explain the writer’s
views. German music may be divided into two
branches; vocal and instrumental: in either of which
it is generally believed to be vastly superior to that of
any other school extant. The list of those who may
be termed modern German masters, is garnished
with the names of Mozart, Haydn, Handel, Weber,
Beethoven, Meyerbeer, Mendelsohn, Spohr, Gluck,
Lortzing, Bach, Listz, De Meyer, Herz, Thalberg,
Moschelles, Herold, and others. Of these Mozart,
Haydn, Beethoven, and Mendelsohn, stand at the
head of a long rank of sacred writers. The solemn
requiems of Mozart, the beautiful “<span class='it'>Creation</span>” of
Haydn; the stirring “<span class='it'>Messiah</span>” of Handel; the
solemn symphonies of Beethoven; the magnificent
“<span class='it'>Elijah</span>” of Bartholdy, will never be forgotten while
a soul attuned to melody remains on earth. They
all appear to have been written in moments of deep
inspiration; and the enthusiast may almost believe
that a <a id='bene'></a>beneficent God may have guided the hands
whose work has more than once struck awe into
the sinner’s soul to call him to repentance, and lifted
up the heart of the pious man to still closer communion
with the God who in his wisdom formed the
noblest of his creatures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the modern opera writers of Germany,
Mozart, Weber, Beethoven, and Meyerbeer, stand
pre-eminently high; and it is difficult at this day to
say which of these writers outdoes the other in boldness
of design, grandeur of conception, brilliancy of
execution, or <a id='depth'></a>depth of feeling. If, for example, we
take the “<span class='it'>Don Giovanni</span>” of Mozart, the “<span class='it'>Der
Freischutz</span>” of Weber, the “<span class='it'>Fidelio</span>” of Beethoven,
and the “<span class='it'>Robert der Teufel</span>” or the “<span class='it'>Huguenots</span>”
of Meyerbeer, we will find in certain scenes equal
attraction in the concerted pieces, similar beauties
in the airs, like effect in the orchestral accompaniments,
and the same grandeur in the choruses.
Each author will therefore have his distinct admirers,
who, notwithstanding any especial partiality,
will readily confess to the attractions of the rival
works. For ourselves, we are yet to hear an opera
superior to the Fidelio of Beethoven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the reasons above stated, it is not possible,
without venturing into matters of detail which would
be uninteresting, to mark the minor differences which
characterize each writer. It will therefore be only
necessary to name some of the principal works of
the principal opera writers of the German school.
The best of Mozart’s efforts are his “<span class='it'>Don Giovanni</span>,”
his “<span class='it'>Così fan Tutte</span>,” his “<span class='it'>Zauberflotte</span>,”
and his “<span class='it'>Nozze di Figaro</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weber’s greatest conceptions are supposed to be
his “<span class='it'>Freischutz</span>,” his “<span class='it'>Oberon</span>,” and his “<span class='it'>Preciosa</span>”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “<span class='it'>Fidelio</span>” of Beethoven stands justly at the
head of all his writings. Of Meyerbeer’s great works
none are held in greater estimation than his “<span class='it'>Robert
le Diable</span>,” his “<span class='it'>Huguenots</span>,” and his “<span class='it'>Crocciatoin
Egitto</span>.” His “<span class='it'>Prophete</span>” is highly spoken of, but
it still remains unknown to the longing ear of the
writer of this essay. Herold’s “<span class='it'>Zampa</span>,” and
Lortzing’s “<span class='it'>Czar und Zimmermann</span>,” are also
in high repute among musicians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In instrumental music, German writers rank as
high as their compatriots do in the operatic school,
and higher than the masters of any other country.
In the more solid flights of art we have Beethoven,
Mozart, Weber, Meyerbeer, Bartholdy, <a id='spohr'></a>Spohr, Gluck,
Bach, Listz, De Meyer, and others. In the lighter
but not less meritorious style of composition, we
have Thalberg, Herz, Moschelles, and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>French music, with the exception of the works
of one or two writers, has never been in favor out of
France. It resembles closely in some points French
poetry. There is harmony, melody, softness, and
sometimes art; but there are wanting grandeur and
loftiness of conception and smoothness. The writings
of David and Auber are, however, exceptions to these
objections. There is a force in David’s “<span class='it'>Desert</span>,”
for example, which excuses comparison even with
German writers; and many of the operas of Auber
have a high place in the estimation of those who incline
to the Italian school, a close resemblance to
which is to be found in some of his writings.
Among the best works of this distinguished musician
are his “<span class='it'>Muette de Portici</span>,” his “<span class='it'>Fra Diavolo</span>,”
and his “<span class='it'>Diamans de la Couronne</span>.” His “<span class='it'>Domino
Noir</span>,” his “<span class='it'>Barcarole</span>,” and others, are also favorites
even beyond the French frontier. Adam’s
“<span class='it'>Postillion de Lonjemeau</span>” is another effort which
must be mentioned with respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are in each of the schools to which I have
adverted many great composers whose names do
not occur to me at this moment. Indeed, it would be
almost impossible to record all those inspired men
who have reflected on their several nations the glory
which music has conferred on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The study of Music is so interesting as to excuse
a very lengthy dissertation, and the present paper
might be considerably prolonged, did the limits of
the Magazine permit a continuation of this already
lengthy essay, in which the several branches of the
subject are only cursorily treated; but I feel that I
need say nothing to recommend to the public of this
country the Divine Art, which, as a German author
beautifully expresses it, “is to Poetry what Poetry
is to language.” It is undoubtedly the poetry of
sound, the sweet harmonizer of society, the chief
luxury of life and the greatest softener and civilizer
of man’s harsh nature.</p>

<p class='line'>From the doorway, Manuela, in the sheeny April morn,</p>
<p class='line'>Southward looks, along the valley, over leagues of gleaming corn;</p>
<p class='line'>Where the mountain’s misty rampart like the wall of Eden towers,</p>
<p class='line'>And the isles of oak are sleeping on a painted sea of flowers.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>All the air is full of music, for the winter rains are o’er,</p>
<p class='line'>And the noisy magpies chatter from the budding sycamore;</p>
<p class='line'>Blithely frisk unnumbered squirrels, over all the grassy slope;</p>
<p class='line'>Where the airy summits brighten, nimbly leaps the antelope.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Gentle eyes of Manuela! tell me wherefore do ye rest</p>
<p class='line'>On the oaks enchanted islands and the flowery ocean’s breast?</p>
<p class='line'>Tell me wherefore, down the valley, ye have traced the highway’s mark</p>
<p class='line'>Far beyond the belts of timber, to the mountain-shadows dark?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Ah, the fragrant bay may blossom, and the sprouting verdure shine</p>
<p class='line'>With the tears of amber dropping from the tassels of the pine,</p>
<p class='line'>And the morning’s breath of balsam lightly brush her sunny cheek—</p>
<p class='line'>Little recketh Manuela of the tales of Spring they speak.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>When the Summer’s burning solstice on the mountain-harvests glowed,</p>
<p class='line'>She had watched a gallant horseman riding down the valley road;</p>
<p class='line'>Many times she saw him turning, looking back with parting thrills,</p>
<p class='line'>Till amid her tears she lost him, in the shadow of the hills.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Ere the cloudless moons were over, he had passed the Desert’s sand,</p>
<p class='line'>Crossed the rushing <a id='col'></a>Colorado and the dark Apachè Land,</p>
<p class='line'>And his laden mules were driven, when the time of rains began,</p>
<p class='line'>With the traders of <a id='chi'></a>Chihuahua, to the Fair of San Juan.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Therefore watches Manuela—therefore lightly doth she start,</p>
<p class='line'>When the sound of distant footsteps seems the beating of her heart;</p>
<p class='line'>Not a wind the green oak rustles or the redwood branches stirs,</p>
<p class='line'>But she hears the silver jingle of his ringing bit and spurs.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Often, out the hazy distance, come the horsemen, day by day,</p>
<p class='line'>But they come not as Bernardo—she can see it, far away;</p>
<p class='line'>Well she knows the airy gallop of his mettled <span class='it'>alazàn</span>,<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>
<p class='line'>Light as any antelope upon the Hills of Gavilàn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>She would know him ’mid a thousand, by his free and gallant air;</p>
<p class='line'>By the featly-knit sarápè,<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> such as wealthy traders wear;</p>
<p class='line'>By his broidered calzoneros<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> and his saddle, gaily spread,</p>
<p class='line'>With its cantle rimmed with silver, and its horn a lion’s head.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>None like he the light riáta<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> on the maddened bull can throw;</p>
<p class='line'>None amid the mountain-cañons, track like he the stealthy doe;</p>
<p class='line'>And at all the Mission festals, few indeed the revelers are</p>
<p class='line'>Who can dance with him the jota, touch with him the gay guitar.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He has said to Manuela, and the echoes linger still</p>
<p class='line'>In the cloisters of her bosom, with a secret, tender thrill,</p>
<p class='line'>When the bay again has blossomed, and the valley stands in corn,</p>
<p class='line'>Shall the bells of Santa Clara usher in the wedding morn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>He has pictured the procession, all in holyday attire,</p>
<p class='line'>And the laugh and look of gladness, when they see the distant spire;</p>
<p class='line'>Then their love shall kindle newly, and the world be doubly fair,</p>
<p class='line'>In the cool, delicious crystal of the summer morning air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>Tender eyes of Manuela! what has dimmed your lustrous beam?</p>
<p class='line'>’Tis a tear that falls to glitter on the casket of her dream.</p>
<p class='line'>Ah, the eye of Love must brighten, if its watches would be true,</p>
<p class='line'>For the star is falsely mirrored in the rose’s drop of dew!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>But her eager eyes rekindle, and her breathless bosom stills,</p>
<p class='line'>As she sees a horseman moving in the shadow of the hills:</p>
<p class='line'>Now in love and fond thanksgiving they may loose their pearly tides—</p>
<p class='line'>’Tis the alazàn that gallops, ’tis Bernardo’s self that rides!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>AN INCIDENT OF THE WAR OF 1812.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY CHARLES J. PETERSON, AUTHOR OF “CRUISING IN THE LAST WAR.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sail O!” cried the look-out from the mast-head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereaway?” asked the officer of the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the lee-beam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been dodging about the horse-latitudes for
several weeks, most of the time becalmed; and,
of course, without meeting a single vessel. At
this announcement, therefore, a general excitement
pervaded the decks; the watch above placed
themselves eagerly on the look-out, while the watch
below crowded up the gangway to catch a glance
of the stranger if possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time the character of the chase became evident.
She was a heavy, fore-topsail schooner, and
apparently a man-of-war. Instead of flying us, as
was the case with most vessels, she stood boldly on
her course, and in consequence was soon within
range. Meantime, through our glasses, we could
see that her decks were filled with men, who appeared
to be eagerly scrutinizing us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Show him our flag,” at last said our captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The roll of bunting ascended to the gaff, and blowing
out, disclosed our country’s ensign, the white
stars sprinkling the field of azure, and the crimson
stripes gleaming out against their white background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No answer came from the schooner, however.
She had apparently mistaken us for a friend, but now
being assured of the contrary, and aware also by this
time of our greatly superior force, she tacked hurriedly,
and went off almost dead before the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give her a shot,” cried the captain, “and see if
that will bring her to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ball went richochetting over the waters, and
passing through her main-sail, plunged into the water
a short distance ahead. A moment after the red-cross
of Britain shot up to the schooner’s gaff, where it
glared, blood-red, in the brazen sky. But, instead
of lying to, the chase steadily kept on her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another shot,” cried the captain; “and let us
see this time if we can’t cripple her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ball whistled sharply across the air, but fell
short of its mark; and another, fired immediately
after, shared the same fate. It was evident that we
were scarcely within range. As every shot deadened
our progress, the captain ordered the gunner to
desist; and, in place of firing, directed the sails to be
wet down. The enemy, with a truer perception of the
character of the combat, had declined, from the first,
to return our shots, but had turned all his energies
to spreading what light sail he could, and throwing
water on his canvas from an engine on board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A stern-chase is a long chase,” said the captain.
“But there is no help for it. However, as the fellow
is a schooner, and we are square-rigged, I do not despair
of eventually overhauling him. I wonder
whether he really is an Englishman; he looks more
like a slaver to my eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chase was, indeed, one of the most beautiful
craft I had ever seen. She was painted of a deep
black, relieved only by a crimson streak in the line
of her ports. The mould of her hull was clean and
graceful; her bows were sharp as a knife; and her
tall, whip-stalk masts, that rose to an immense
height, raked backwards with an air at once saucy
and beautiful. A high bulwark, with a monkey rail
running aft, concealed her decks entirely; but the
number of faces peering at us, and the row of ports,
proved her to be no mere yacht, as otherwise might
have been supposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That craft,” I replied, “was never built in
England. There’s not a naval architect in the whole
three kingdoms—take my word for it—who could
turn out such a beautiful model. I’d bet a month’s
pay that good, solid Rappahanock timbers hold her
together, and that there’s more than one shipwright
in Baltimore has handled the adze upon her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she must be a slaver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not. And you will agree with me when
you have reflected a moment. We are a week’s sail
out of the track of such scoundrels. Besides that
craft carries too many men for a slaver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” answered the captain, after a
moment’s thought. “But what can she be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is more than I can tell. She may be either
an Englishman or a pirate—more likely the latter
than the former; for the British, even when they
capture one of our fast-sailing schooners, are not apt
to commission them; the lazy islanders think them
too wet forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pirate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! we have heard of several being about the
West Indies, and this may be one, who, having
followed the homeward-bound fleet, in hopes to catch
a stray prize, has been, like ourselves, set into these
infernal latitudes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You reason well,” said the captain. “However,
we shall soon know. We evidently gain upon her.
I think we could now reach her with our guns.
But,” he added, after hesitating a moment, “we’ll
keep on till we range alongside, and then give him a
broadside that will settle him at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plan of the captain was not destined, however,
to succeed. He had scarcely spoken when the wind
began perceptibly to die away, and before an hour it
was almost a dead calm. Puffs of air, indeed, would
occasionally distend our sails for awhile and urge us
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
on a space, but the effect of this, on the whole, was
to increase rather than lessen the distance between
us and the chase, the latter making more headway
in a light breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the middle of the afternoon we were rocking
on the surface of the deep, with every sail set, yet
without advancing an inch. The day had been intensely
sultry, and now that not a breath of air was
stirring, the heat became almost insupportable. The
vertical rays of the tropical sun, pouring down on
our white decks, nearly blinded the eyesight; but in
vain we turned our gaze elsewhere to seek relief, for
the broad expanse of ocean to the very verge of the
horizon, glowed like molten silver; while above the
fiery luminary blazed in a sky of brass. Panting and
exhausted we lay about the decks, or leaned over
the sides gasping for air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the hours wore on the captain began to show
signs of uneasiness. He would look first at the sails
and then at the chase, then up at our idle canvas again,
and once more at the stranger. At last he addressed
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night will soon be here,” he said, “and
under cover of it this fellow may escape. Since
your suggestion that he may be a pirate, I feel doubly
anxious to capture him. What do you think of
carrying him with the boats?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I mused a moment before I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be a perilous enterprise,” I answered
at last, “but I think it might be made to succeed.
If you are willing, sir, to risk the lives of the men, I
shall be willing to lead the attack; only, if the attempt
is to be made, the sooner it is done the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then my mind is made up.” And elevating his
voice, he cried, “Boatswain, pipe away the boat’s
crews; we will cut out the chase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long inaction to which the men had been subjected,
made them especially eager for a prize; and
thus, notwithstanding the depressing influence of
the atmosphere, they welcomed the enterprise with
joy. In a comparatively short time we were speeding
across the waters, the launch, with myself in command,
leading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How shall I describe that long pull across the hot
and glittering deep? The men baring their brawny
arms, bent steadily to their oars, yet reserving their
strength at first with the caution long experience had
taught them. And well was it that they acted thus!
Soon great drops of perspiration gathered on their
brows, and rolled down their swarthy chests, and before
long it became evident that, with all their care,
the task before them would prove almost beyond their
strength. Indeed, in all my experience, I had never
known a day so debilitating. As we proceeded, too,
the atmosphere appeared to become more and more
suffocating, until several of the men, in the different
boats, actually gave out, declaring they could not
breathe and work both. The difficulty of respiration
on my part assured me that there was no pretence
in this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the schooner, like a ship painted on
canvas, lay motionless on the deep, her whole figure
reflected in the water, from the trucks down. Occasionally
a light ripple would ruffle this shadow for a
second, betraying its real character, but at other
times it required but little fancy to imagine the reflection
an inverted ship, and no mere cheat of the
imagination. The men on board the chase were not,
however, idle, but busily engaged in tricing up the hammock
nettings; and when we had approached nearer,
a carronade was run back to her stern, aimed at us,
and fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better luck next time,” ironically said an old
sea-dog, who pulled the stroke-oar of my boat, as the
ball plumped into the water just ahead of us. “The
man that trained that gun don’t understand his business,
shipmates. We’ll be on board directly, if we
pull sharp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my lads,” I cried, “it’s no time to trifle
now. The next ball may be truer sent. Besides,”
I added, glancing over my shoulder at a black cloud
rising rapidly in the sky, “this close atmosphere has
not been without its meaning; yonder is a thunder-squall
coming up, and if we don’t carry the schooner
before it overtakes us, there may be the devil
to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men gave a cheer to show that they were
ready to do their best, and bent, with renewed vigor,
to their oars. Under this momentary excitement the
boats surged along at a vastly accelerated rate, and
the schooner rapidly drew within musket-shot. At
this point another jet of fire was seen to flash from
the carronade astern; a cloud of white smoke
puffing out, broke away over the quarter, and then,
with a dull report across the murky air, a ball came
skipping toward us, striking the bow oar just as it
rose from the water, and breaking the ashen blade,
while it knocked the seaman over on his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pull, with a will, boys, pull,” I cried, excited by
the peril; “dash in on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” answered my men; and we shot like
an arrow along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Intent as I was on reaching the schooner before
the carronade could be loaded again, I scarcely had
noticed the rapid changes of the sky. I only knew
that the air was growing thicker than ever, and that
the clouds had completely shut in the sun. But now,
when I saw the men at the carronade abandon it,
and all hands address themselves to taking in sail, I
knew that the danger from the squall was close and
imminent; and I looked hastily up and around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I had called the attention of my men,
scarcely ten minutes before, to the approaching tempest,
there had been only a small cloud perceptible
far down on the seaboard. But now, from pole to
pole, and all round the horizon, a vast, black curtain
shut out the light of day; yet not entirely shut it out,
for here and there a lurid gleam, like that seen
through the chinks of a furnace, penetrated the
thick vapors. Over and over, in vast whirling masses,
tossed and tumbled the inky clouds. The ghostly
radiance that broke, as I have said, through the gaps
of the ominous curtain, threw a spectral gleam across
the seas that conjured up visions of dread and disaster.
Oh! never can I forget that spectacle. The
sultry closeness of the air; the sudden and sepulchral
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
stillness; the awful gloom, and the lurid glare, like
that from the bottomless pit, all seemed to say that
sea and sky were at their last gasp, and that the great
day of judgment had arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men had made the same observations, and
apparently came to similar conclusions, for they
ceased rowing, as if under a spell, while a look of
blank horror occupied their faces. Every eye was
turned toward me for a moment, and then, as by one
common impulse, directed at the ship. Far up in
the distance, almost undistinguishable against the
sable back-ground, the —— was faintly visible. She
was stripped entirely bare, with the exception of a
bit of head-sail, which glowing red and ghastly in
the sepulchral light, gave her the appearance of a
demon vessel. Nor was this first impression removed
on a second view, but rather heightened, so
unearthly was the effect produced by the faint outlines
of her spars, which were seen a moment and
then lost to sight, like those of some spectral ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, while we were thus looking at our distant
craft, a dazzling, blinding glare shot athwart
the firmament, and as instantly vanished, leaving
eye and brain, however, dizzy with that instant of
concentrated light. A sulphurous smell, at the same
moment, pervaded the atmosphere. Then followed
a roar so stunning, so close at hand, that, if a thousand
batteries had been discharged right overhead,
the noise could not have been more deafening. For
a second I thought one of the boats, or at least the
schooner, had been struck by the lightning; but when
my brain ceased reeling, I saw they had escaped.
This dazzling flash, this awful thunder-clap were
succeeded by a darkness and silence as profound, as
oppressive, as foreboding as before. Then came a
few rain-drops, which, big and heavy, pattered, like
huge hail-stones, on the waters around us. These
were followed by another silence as deep as before;
and then the hurricane, with a roar like a lion, was
upon us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be vain to attempt finding language adequate
to describe what followed. In an instant the
air was filled with millions of particles of spray,
which, torn from the surface of the deep, and
carried in the arms of the tempest, hid every thing,
except objects within a few feet, entirely from sight.
The stinging of these fine particles, as they struck
the cheek, was like that of mustard-shot. Meantime
the force of the wind was such that it was impossible
to sit erect—and all stooped, as if by a common
impulse, before the blast. Shading my eyes with
my hand, to protect the orbs from the spray, I glanced
at the place where the schooner had been last seen.
But she was no longer visible there. A moment
after, however, in a casual opening of the prospect,
I caught a glimpse of her form, far away ahead, as,
half buried in mist, she drove, like a sheeted spectre,
before the gale. The instant after she vanished from
my vision, and the squall closed around us like the
walls of a dungeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately the launch was already before the
wind, so that we had only to hold on, and wait the
issue. The other boats were soon out of sight, and
speedily out of hearing also. I could, therefore, do
nothing for the rest of my command, and resigning
myself to fate, I bent my head between my knees,
ordered the men to lie down, and so let the hurricane
have its way. The rain was now falling, as
it falls only in the tropics, in vast sheets of water:
the drops, instead of descending perpendicularly,
driving slantingly before the hurricane, and striking
the water with gigantic force, keeping the deep in
commotion all around. The hissing of the rain, the
roar of the tempest, the blinding glare of lightning,
and the terrific thunder-claps combined to make a
scene more awful than I had ever witnessed in
all my long experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For half an hour the storm continued in its fury.
At the end of that time the intense darkness began
to give way; but it was nearly half an hour
more before the squall had entirely passed over us.
At last the rain ceased, the clouds began to break,
and the wind in part subsided. I now ventured, for
the first time since the tempest had burst upon us, to
rise up and look around. I was anxious to see what
had become of the remaining boats, as well as to
learn in what direction our ship was; for the
schooner, I had no doubt from the speed with which
I saw her going last, was hull down on the horizon
by this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eagerly I scanned the prospect, therefore. My
first object of search was the ship, for I knew that
on her depended our safety. Her greater size had
placed her, I reasoned, even more at the power of
the gale than ourselves, and consequently I looked
for her to be in advance of us considerably. I had
fancied, indeed, during the height of the hurricane,
that I saw her tall masts, for a single instant, shooting,
meteor-like, past us: but in the blinding rain
that then closed in the prospect, it was easy, I was
sure, to be deceived. My search, however, for her
was unsuccessful. Nowhere, on the whole horizon,
was she or the schooner to be seen. Up to windward,
where it was now entirely clear, the view
was unbroken; and she was plainly not there. In
front, for a long distance, the prospect was equally
unbroken; but she was not in sight in this direction
either. Far down, however, in the furthest horizon,
where the squall was disappearing, there still hung
a black cloud, from which the sullen thunder occasionally
growled, and across whose gloomy front the
lightning, every few minutes, crinkled. That dark
curtain, I knew, enveloped our missing ship, or else
she, and her three hundred souls, were buried in the
deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a heavy sigh I beheld this condition of affairs.
Parted from the ship, without water or provisions
on board, destitute even of a compass, and with
night coming on, our situation was indeed piteous in
the extreme. How far the squall might carry the
ship before outrunning her, it was impossible to conjecture.
Perhaps, when the hurricane should be
over for our comrades on board, the gallant craft
might be hull down on the horizon. In that event,
though she would naturally retrace her path to seek
us, night might shut in before we could be seen from
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
the mast-head even: and, in the darkness that would
follow, nothing could be easier than for her entirely
to miss us. Days, in that event, would probably
elapse before we would be picked up, if ever. The
thought was terrible, and I turned from it, sick at
heart, to look for the other boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was not, indeed, without misgivings as to the
fate of these. The launch, being large, was better
fitted to ride out the gale than her companions, and
I expected that the smaller of the two boats, at least,
had been swamped. However, I soon discovered
both her and her companion, one about a cable’s
length astern, and the other nearly abeam. With a
glad hallo, that sounded strangely on the now lonely
seas, my crew took to their oars, and pulled rapidly
in the direction of the boat abeam, the one astern
following our example. The first voice I heard was
the junior lieutenant’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you see any thing of the ship?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” I replied, “she is entirely out of sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is to be done?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have no water or provisions on board, I
suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but a beaker of water, and not a solitary
biscuit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it to the nearest land?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About five hundred miles, I take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I thought,” I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I mused for a moment, the crews of the
three boats resting on their oars, and looking eagerly
at me. Every man knew, as well as myself, that,
in all likelihood, we should never see the ship
again: in which event a lingering death by starvation
was our almost inevitable doom. On my decision,
whether to pull after the ship, which would
carry us further from land, or, abandoning the hope
of meeting the ship, seek to reach the coast by the
nearest route, hung, perhaps, our lives: and all were
aware of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Follow the squall,” I said, at last, turning my
eyes to the dark cloud, now fast disappearing on the
eastern horizon, “it is our only chance. If we don’t
find the ship we are dead men. It is madness to
think of reaching land.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would to God the sun was a few hours higher!”
said the lieutenant, looking at that luminary, which
now hung, a blazing orb, a few degrees only above
the horizon. “We haven’t even a lantern on board,
to show a light!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing further was said. The boats were headed
east, the men bent to their tasks, and, in another
minute, the little fleet was speeding silently across
the waters. But with what different feelings from
those with which we set out from the ship two
hours before!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the time wore on, and the sun declined lower
to the horizon, yet still no sign of the ship became
visible, our hearts sunk within us. The squall in
the distance had now dwindled to a bank of clouds,
low on the furthest seaboard; but no vestige of the
ship, between it and us, was perceptible. At last the
sun’s disc touched the western horizon, and, in another
instant, had entirely disappeared. Darkness,
deep and profound, now fell upon us; for, in that
tropical latitude, there is no twilight to prolong, in
part, the day. As the gloom settled around us, a
deep drawn breath rose from the boat’s crew: it was
an involuntary expression of the general feeling,
that, with the sun, hope too had set.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For more than an hour we pulled on in silence.
As no sail had been in sight when darkness shut in,
it was useless to hail: and so we continued without
a word being spoken. Not a sound, therefore, broke
the hush except the measured rollicking of the oars,
and the surging noise of the launch as it was propelled
heavily through the water. The darkness
still continued, for numerous clouds flecked the sky,
and every here and there, in consequence, would a
star find its way out. But in the azure west, like a
lustrous gem, there shone through all one bright,
large orb, whose light, flickering and dancing along
the water, cheered us with its beauty and kept us
from entirely desponding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the old veteran, whom I have before
alluded to, looked up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’m not mistaken, sir,” he said, addressing
me, “there’s a bunch of rockets in the locker in the
stern-sheets. They were put there by the gunner
some days ago, and have never, I believe, been removed.
At any rate it is worth while to look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never did I hear words sweeter to my ears. I
was up in an instant and searching the locker. Sure
enough, as the old tar had said, the rockets were
still there, the result of a carelessness which now
appeared to me to have been little less than providential.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intelligence was immediately announced to
the other boats; and the crews, inspired by the news,
rested on their oars, as of one accord, and gave vent
to three hearty cheers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will signal the ship,” I said to my second in
command, “and if she is any where within range
of vision, we shall hear from her instantly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, I let off two rockets in rapid succession.
The fiery missiles shot up to a great height in
the sky, and falling in a shower of stars, illuminated
the horizon far and near for a moment. Many an
eye, during that half instant, scanned the seaboard
eagerly, in order to see if the ship was in sight; but
not a sign of her was perceptible, and a deep sigh
told the disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, however, did not yet despair. I knew that the
ship, though invisible in that partial light, might still
be near enough to discern our rockets; and I was
well aware that on board of her half a hundred eager
eyes were at this moment on the look-out. Without
despair, yet with a beating heart, I watched for the
reply to my signal. One minute passed, and then
another, but still there was no sign of an answering
rocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart grew faint. My limbs tottered beneath
me. Minute after minute succeeded, and my hopes
were gradually dwindling away—when suddenly the
old tar before me shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Huzza, there she goes! Huzza—huzza—we are
safe, lads, huzza!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
Quick as thought my eyes followed his, and I
saw, far off, apparently on the very surface of the
water, a single spark of light. But that spark grew
and grew, and, as it grew, it rose, until finally it
ascended high into the blue ether, leaving a train of
light, comet-like, behind it. All at once it burst into
a dozen fire-balls, some blue and some red, which,
hovering a moment in mid-air, fell at last slowly toward
the deep. Every one who saw those colors
was aware of their meaning: they were the well-known
signals of our gallant ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a shout as then went up to the sky! It
rings in my ears even yet, and the very memory of
it makes the blood leap quicker in my veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two hours after we were safely on board, having
been guided on our way by signal rockets till the
ship came into sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the schooner, we never saw her more!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The moment she had disappeared from the kitchen,
the negro was taken forth by the captain of loyalists,
who by this time had surrounded himself with nearly
all his band. A single soldier had been stationed by
Clymes between the house and kitchen, in order to
arrest the approach of any of the whites from the
former to the scene where Brough was about to pass
a certain painful ordeal. The stout old African doggedly,
with a single shake of his head, obeyed his
captors, as they ordered him to a neighboring wood—a
small copse of scrubby oaks, that lay between
the settlement and the swamp forest along the river.
Here, without delay, Brough was commanded, on
pain of rope and hickory, to deliver up the secret of
Richard Coulter’s hiding-place. But the old fellow
had promised to be faithful. He stubbornly refused
to know or to reveal any thing. The scene which
followed is one that we do not care to describe in detail.
The reader must imagine its particulars. Let it suffice
that the poor old creature was haltered by the neck,
and drawn up repeatedly to the swinging limb of a
tree, until the moral nature, feeble at best, and overawed
by the terrors of the last mortal agony, surrendered
in despair. Brough consented to conduct
the party to the hiding-place of Richard Coulter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The savage nature of Matthew Dunbar was now
in full exercise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boots and saddle!” was the cry; and, with the
negro, both arms pinioned, and running at the head
of one of the dragoon’s horses, leashed to the stirrup-leather,
and in constant danger, should he be found
tripping, of a sudden sabre cut, the whole party, with
two exceptions, made their way down the country,
and under the guidance of the African. Two of the
soldiers had been placed in watch upon the premises,
with instructions, however, to keep from sight, and
not suffer their proximity to be suspected. But the
suspicion of such an arrangement in existence was
now natural enough to a mind, like that of Frederica
Sabb, made wary by her recent misfortune. She
was soon apprised of the departure of the loyalist
troop. She was soon taught to fear from the weakness
of poor Brough. What was to be done? Was
her lover to be caught in the toils? Was she to become
indirectly the agent of his destruction? She
determined at all events to forego no effort by which
to effect his escape. She was a girl of quick wit,
and prompt expedients. No longer exposing herself
in her white cotton garments, she wrapped herself
closely up in the great brown overcoat of her father,
which buried her person from head to foot. She
stole forth from the front entrance with cautious footsteps,
employing tree and shrub for her shelter whenever
they offered. In this way she moved forward
to a spot inclining to the river, but taking an upward
route, one which she naturally concluded had been
left without a guard. But her objects required finally
that she should change her course, and take the
downward path, as soon as she could persuade herself
that her progress was fairly under cover. Still
she knew not but that she was seen, and perhaps
followed, as well as watched. The spy might arrest
her at the very moment when she was most hopeful
of her object. How to guard against this danger?
How to attain the necessary security? The question
was no sooner formed than answered. Her way lay
through a wilderness of leaves. The silent droppings
from the trees for many years had accumulated
around her, and their constant crinkling beneath her
tread, drawing her notice to this source of fear,
suggested to her the means of safety. There had not
been a rain for many weeks. The earth was parched
with thirst. The drought had driven the sap from
shrub and plant; and just below, on the very route
taken by the pursuing party, a natural meadow, a
long, thin strip, the seat of a bayou or lake long
since dried up, was covered with a rank forest of
broom-grass, parched and dried by the sun. The
wind was fresh, and driving right below. To one
familiar with the effect of firing the woods in a
southern country under such circumstances, the idea
which possessed the mind of our heroine was almost
intuitive. She immediately stole back to the house,
her eagerness finding wings, which, however, did not
betray her caution. The sentinels of Dunbar kept
easy watch, but she had not been unseen. The cool,
deliberate tory had more than once fitted his finger to
the trigger of his horseman’s pistol, as he beheld the
approach toward him of the shrouded figure. But
he was not disposed to show himself, or to give the
alarm before he could detect the objects of his unknown
visiter. Her return to the house was not beheld.
He had lost sight of her in the woods, and
fancied her still to be in the neighborhood. Unable
to recover his clue, he still maintained his position
waiting events. It was not long before she reappeared
upon the scene. He did not see the figure,
until it crossed an open space, on his right, in the direction
of the river. He saw it stoop to the earth,
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
and he then bounded forward. His haste was injurious
to his objects. He fell over the prostrate
trunk of a pine, which had been thrown down
for ranging timber only a few days before, and lay
dark, with all its bark upon it, in the thick cover of
the grass. His pistol went off in his fall, and before
he could recover his feet, he was confounded to find
himself threatened by a rapid rushing forest of flame,
setting directly toward him. For a moment, the
sudden blaze blinded him, and when he opened his
eyes fully upon surrounding objects, he saw nothing
human—nothing but the great dark shafts of pine,
beneath which the fire was rushing with the roar
and volume of swollen billows of the sea, breaking
upon the shore which they promised to engulf. To
save himself, to oppose fire to fire, or pass boldly
through the flame where it burned most feebly, was
now a first necessity; and we leave him to extricate
himself as he may, while we follow the progress of
Frederica Sabb. The flame which she had kindled
in the dry grass and leaves, from the little old stable-lantern
of the cottage, concealed beneath the great-coat
of her father, had sufficed as a perfect cover to
her movements. The fire swept below, and in the
direction of the tory sentinels. The advance of the
one she had perceived, in the moment when she was
communicating the blazing candle to the furze. She
fancied she was shot when she heard the report of
the pistol; but pressing her hand to her heart, the
lantern still in her grasp, she darted headlong forward
by one of the paths leading directly to the river.
The fire was now raging over all the tract between
her and the tory sentries. Soon she descended from
the pine ridge, and passed into the low flat land,
strewed with gray cypresses, with their thousand
<span class='it'>knees</span>, or abutments. The swamp was nearly dry.
She found her way along a well known path to the
river, and from beneath a clump of shrouding willows,
drew forth a little <span class='it'>dugout</span>, the well known cypress
canoe of the country. This was a small egg-shell
like structure, scarcely capable of holding two persons,
which she was well accustomed to manage.
At once she pushed boldly out into the broad stream,
whose sweet rippling flow, a continuous and gentle
murmur, was strangely broken by the intense roar
and crackling of the fire as it swept the broad track
of stubble, dry grass and leaves, which lay in its
path. The lurid shadows sometimes passed over the
surface of the stream, but naturally contributed to
increase her shelter. With a prayer that was inaudible
to herself, she invoked Heaven’s mercy on
her enterprise, as with a strong arm, familiar in this
exercise, she plied from side to side, the little paddle
which, with the favoring currents of the river, soon
carried her down toward the bit of swamp forest
where her lover found his refuge. The spot was
well known to the maiden, though we must do her
the justice to say, she would never have sought for
Richard Coulter in its depths, but for an emergency
like the present. It was known as “Bear Castle,”
a close thicket covering a sort of promontory, three-fourths
of which was encircled by the river, while
the remaining quarter was a deep swamp, through
which, at high water, a streamlet forced its way,
converting the promontory into an islet. It was unfortunate
for Coulter and his party that, at this season
the river was much lower than usual, and the swamp
offered no security on the land side, unless from the
denseness of the forest vegetation. It might now be
passed dry shod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distance from “Bear Castle” to the farmstead
of old Frederick Sabb, was, by land, but four or five
miles. By water it was fully ten. If, therefore,
the stream favored the progress of our heroine, the
difference against Dunbar and his tories was more
than equalled by the shorter route before him, and
the start which he had made in advance of Frederica.
But Brough was no willing guide. He opposed frequent
difficulties to the distasteful progress, and as
they neared the spot, Dunbar found it necessary to
make a second application of the halter before the
good old negro could be got forward. The love of
life, the fear of death, proved superior to his loyalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brough would have borne any quantity of flogging—nay,
he could, perhaps, have perished under the
scourge without confessing, but his courage failed,
when the danger was of being launched headlong
into eternity. A shorter process than the cord or
swinging limb would not have found him so pliant.
With a choking groan he promised to submit, and
with heart swollen almost to bursting, he led the
route, off from the main road now, and through the
sinuous little foot-paths which conducted to the place
of refuge of our patriots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this point, having ascertained what space
lay between him and his enemy, that Dunbar dismounted
his troopers. The horses were left with a
guard, while the rest of his men, under his personal
lead, made their further progress on foot. His object
was a surprise. He designed that the negro
should give the “usual” signal with which he had
been taught to approach the camp of the fugitive,
and this signal—a shrill whistle, three times sounded,
with a certain measured pause between each utterance—was
to be given when the swamp was entered
over which the river, in high stages of the water,
made its breach. These instructions were all rigidly
followed. Poor Brough, with the rope about his
neck, and the provost ready to fling the other end
of the cord over the convenient arm of a huge sycamore
under which they stood, was incapable of resistance.
But his strength was not equal to his submission.
His whistle was but feebly sounded. His
heart failed him and his voice; and a repeated contraction
of the cord, in the hands of the provost, was
found essential to make him repeat the effort, and
give more volume to his voice. In the meanwhile,
Dunbar cautiously pushed his men forward. They
packed through great hollows, where, at full water,
the alligator wallowed; where the whooping crane
sought his prey at nightfall; where the fox slept in
safety, and the wild-cat in a favorite domain. “Bear
Castle” was the fortress of many fugitives. Aged
cypresses lay like the foundations of ancient walls
along the path, and great thorny vines, and flaming,
flowery creepers flaunted their broad streamers in
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
the faces of the midnight gropers through their solitudes.
The route would have been almost impassable
during the day for men on horseback; it was a
tedious and toilsome progress by night for men on
foot. But Dunbar, nothing doubting of the proximity
of his enemy, went forward with an eagerness which
only did not forget its caution.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The little party of Richard Coulter consisted of
four persons beside himself. It was, perhaps, an
hour before this that he sat apart from the rest
conversing with one of his companions. This was
no other than Elijah Fields, the Methodist preacher.
He had become a volunteer chaplain among the
patriots of his own precinct, and one who, like the
Bishop of Beauvais, did not scruple to wield the
weapons of mortal warfare as well as those of the
church. It is true he was not ostentatious in the
manner of the performance; and this, perhaps, somewhat
increases its merit. He was the man for an
emergency, forgetting his prayer when the necessity
for blows was pressing, and duly remembering his
prayers when the struggle was no longer doubtful.
Yet Elijah Fields was no hypocrite. He was a true,
strong-souled man, with blood, will, energies, and
courage, as well as devotion, and a strong passion
for the soil which gave him birth. In plain terms
he was the patriot as well as the preacher, and his
manhood was required for both vocations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To him Richard Coulter, now a captain among
the partisans of Sumter, had unfolded the narrative
of his escape from Dunbar. They had taken their
evening meal; their three companions were busy
with their arms and horses, grouped together in the
centre of the camp. Our two principal persons occupied
a little headland on the edge of the river,
looking up the stream. They were engaged in certain
estimates with regard to the number of recruits
expected daily, by means of which Coulter was in
hopes to turn the tables on his rival; becoming the
hunter instead of the fugitive. We need not go over
the grounds of their discussion, and refer to the
general progress of events throughout the state.
Enough to say that the Continental army, defeated
under Gates, was in course of re-organization, and
re-approaching under Greene; that Marion had been
recently active and successful below; and that Sumter,
defeated by Tarleton at Fishing Creek, was
rapidly recruiting his force at the foot of the mountains.
Richard Coulter had not been utterly unsuccessful
in the same business along the Edisto. A
rendezvous of his recruits was appointed to take
place on the ensuing Saturday; and, at this rendezvous,
it was hoped that he would find at least thirty
stout fellows in attendance. But we anticipate. It
was while in the discussion of these subjects that
the eyes of Coulter, still looking in the direction of
his heart, were attracted by the sudden blaze which
swept the forests, and dyed in lurid splendor the
very face of heaven. It had been the purpose of
Frederica Sabb, in setting fire to the undergrowth,
not only to shelter her own progress, but in this way
to warn her lover of his danger. But the effect was
to alarm him for <span class='it'>her</span> safety rather than his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fire is at Sabb’s place,” was his first remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like it,” was the reply of the preacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be that Dunbar has burnt the old man’s
dwelling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hardly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is not too good for it, or for any thing monstrous.
He has burnt others—old Rumph’s—Ferguson’s,
and many more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! but he prefers to own, and not destroy old
Sabb’s. As long as he has a hope of getting Frederica,
he will scarcely commit such an outrage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if she has refused him—if she answers him,
as she feels, scornfully—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even then he will prefer to punish in a different
way. He will rather choose to take the place by
confiscation than burn it. He has never put that
fire, or it is not at Sabb’s, but this side of, or beyond
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be the act of some drunken trooper. At
all events, it requires that we should be on the look-out.
I will scout it for a while and see what the
mischief is. Do you, meanwhile, keep every thing
ready for a start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fire will never reach us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not with this wind, perhaps; but the enemy
may. He evidently beat the woods after my heels
this evening, and may be here to-morrow, on my
track. We must be prepared. Keep the horses
saddled and bitted, and your ears open for any summons.
Ha! by heavens, that is Brough’s signal
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it Brough’s? If so, it is scarcely from Brough
in a healthy state. The old fellow must have caught
cold going to and fro at all hours in the service of
Cupid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our preacher was disposed to be merry at the expense
of our lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is Brough’s signal, but feeble, as if the
old fellow was really sick. He has probably passed
through this fire, and has been choked with the
smoke. But he must have an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, eager to hear from his beloved one, our hero
gave his whistle in reply, and moved forward in the
direction of the isthmus. The preacher, meanwhile,
went toward the camp, quite prompt in the performance
of the duties assigned him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He answers,” muttered the tory captain; “the
rebels are delivered to our hands!” And his preparations
were sternly prosecuted to make a satisfactory
finish to the adventure of the night. He, too, it
must be remarked, though somewhat wondering at
the blazing forest behind him, never for a moment
divined the real original of the conflagration. He
ascribed it to accident, and, possibly, to the carelessness
of one of the troopers whom he left as sentinels.
With an internal resolution to make the fellow,
if offending, familiar with the halberds, he
pushed forward, as we have seen, till reaching the
swamp; while the fire, obeying the course of the
wind, swept away to the right of the path kept by
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
the pursuing party, leaving them entirely without
cause of apprehension from this quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plans of Dunbar for penetrating the place of
Coulter’s refuge were as judicious as they could be
made under the circumstances. Having brought the
troopers to the verge of the encampment, the negro
was fastened to a tree by the same rope which had
so frequently threatened his neck. The tories pushed
forward, each with pistol cocked and ready in the
grasp. They had scattered themselves abroad, so
as to form a front sufficient to cover, at moderate intervals,
the space across the isthmus. But, with
the withdrawal of the immediate danger, Brough’s
courage returned to him, and, to the furious rage
and discomfiture of Dunbar, the old negro set up on
a sudden a most boisterous African howl—such a
song as the Ebo cheers himself with when in the
doubtful neighborhood of a jungle which may hide
the lion or the tiger. The sounds re-echoed through
the swamp, and startled, with a keen suspicion, not
only our captain of patriots, but the preacher and his
associates. Brough’s voice was well known to
them all; but that Brough should use it after such a
fashion was quite as unexpected to them as to Dunbar
and his tories. One of the latter immediately
dropped back, intending to knock the negro regularly
on the head; and, doubtless, such would have
been the fate of the fellow, had it not been for the
progress of events which called him elsewhere.
Richard Coulter had pressed forward at double
quick time as he heard the wild chant of the African,
and, being familiar with the region, it occupied but
little space to enable him to reach the line across
which the party of Dunbar was slowly making its
way. Hearing but a single footfall, and obtaining a
glimpse of a single figure only, Coulter repeated his
whistle. He was answered with a pistol shot—another
and another followed; and he had time only
to wind his bugle, giving the signal of flight to his
comrades, when he felt a sudden sickness at the
heart, and a faintness which only did not affect his
senses. He could still feel his danger, and his
strength sufficed to enable him to roll himself close
beside the massive trunk of the cypress, upon which
he had unhappily been perched when his whistle
drew the fire upon him of several of the approaching
party. Scarcely had he thus covered himself from
a random search when he sunk into insensibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, “Bear Castle” rang with the signals
of alarm and assault. At the first sound of danger,
Elijah Fields dashed forward in the direction which
Coulter had taken. But the private signal which he
sounded for the other was unanswered, and the
assailants were now breaking through the swamp,
and were to be heard on every hand. To retreat, to
rally his comrades, to mount their steeds, dash into
the river and take the stream was all the work of
an instant. From the middle of the sweeping current
the shouts of hate and defiance came to the ears
of the tories as they broke from the copse and
appeared on the banks of the river. A momentary
glimpse of the dark bulk of one or more steeds as
they whirled round an interposing headland, drew
from them the remaining bullets in their pistols, but
without success; and, ignorant of the effect of a random
bullet upon the very person whom, of all, he
most desired to destroy, Mat Dunbar felt himself
once more foiled in a pursuit which he had this time
undertaken with every earnest of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That d—d African!” was his exclamation.
“But he shall hang for it now, though he never
hung before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this pious resolution, having, with torches,
made such an exploration of Bear Castle as left them
in no doubt that all the fugitives had escaped, our
tory captain called his squad together, and commenced
their return. The fatigue of passing through
the dry swamp on their backward route was much
greater than when they entered it. They were then
full of excitement, full of that rapture of the strife
which needs not even the feeling of hate and revenge
to make it grateful to an eager and impulsive temper.
Now, they were baffled—the excitement was at an
end—and with the feeling of perfect disappointment
came the full feeling of all the toils and exertions
they had undergone. They had but one immediate
consolation in reserve, and that was the hanging of
Brough, which Dunbar promised them. The howl
of the African had defeated their enterprise. The
African must howl no longer. Bent on murder, they
hastened to the tree where they had left him bound,
only to meet with a new disappointment. The African
was there no longer!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It would be difficult to describe the rage and fury
of our captain of loyalists when he made this discovery.
The reader will imagine it all. But what
was to be done? Was the prey to be entirely lost?
And by what agency had Brough made his escape?
He had been securely fastened, it was thought, and
in such a way as seemed to render it impossible that
he should have been extricated from his bonds without
the assistance of another. This conjecture led
to a renewal of the search. The rope which fastened
the negro lay upon the ground, severed, as by a knife,
in several places. Now, Brough could not use his
hands. If he could, there would have been no sort
of necessity for using his knife. Clearly, he had
found succor from another agency than his own.
Once more our loyalists darted into the recesses of
Bear Castle, their torches were to be seen flaring in
every part of that dense patch of swamp forest, as
they waved them over every spot which seemed to
promise concealment to the fugitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” cried Dunbar, whose ears were quickened
by eager and baffled passions. “Hark! I hear
the dip of a paddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. They darted forth from the woods,
and when they reached the river’s edge, they had
a glimpse of a small dark object, which they readily
conceived to be a canoe, just rounding one of the
projections of the shore and going out of sight, a full
hundred yards below. Here was another mystery.
The ramifications of Bear Castle seemed numerous;
and, mystified as well as mortified, Dunbar, after a
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
tedious delay, and a search fruitlessly renewed, took
up the line of march back for old Sabb’s cottage,
inly resolved to bring the fair Frederica to terms,
or, in some way, to make her pay the penalty for
his disappointments of the night. He little dreamed
how much she had to do with them, nor that her
hand had fired the forest grasses, whose wild and
terrific blaze had first excited the apprehensions and
compelled the caution of the fugitives. It is for us
to show what further agency she exercised in this
nocturnal history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left her, alone, in her little dug-out, paddling
or drifting down the river with the stream. She
pursued this progress with proper caution. In approaching
the headlands around which the river
swept, on that side which was occupied by Dunbar,
she suspended the strokes of her paddle, leaving her
silent boat to the direction of the currents. The
night was clear and beautiful, and the river undefaced
by shadow, except when the current bore her
beneath the overhanging willows which grew numerously
along the margin, or when the winds flung
great masses of smoke from the burning woods
across its bright, smooth surface. With these exceptions,
the river shone in a light not less clear and
beautiful because vague and capricious. Moonlight
and starlight seem to make a special atmosphere for
youth, and the heart which loves, even when most
troubled with anxieties for the beloved one, never,
at such a season, proves wholly insensible to the
soft, seductive influences of such an atmosphere.
Our Frederica was not the heroine of convention.
She had never imbibed romance from books; but
she had affections out of which books might be
written, filled with all those qualities, at once strong
and tender, which make the heroine in the moment
of emergency. Her heart softened, as, seated in the
centre of her little vessel, she watched the soft light
upon the wave, or beheld it dripping, in bright, light
droplets, like fairy glimmers, through the over-hanging
foliage. Of fear—fear for herself—she had
no feeling. Her apprehensions were all for Richard
Coulter, and her anxieties increased as she approached
the celebrated promontory and swamp
forest, known to this day upon the river as “Bear
Castle.” She might be too late. The captain of
the loyalists had the start of her, and her only hope
lay in the difficulties by which he must be delayed,
going through a <span class='it'>blind</span> forest and under imperfect
guidance—for she still had large hopes of Brough’s
fidelity. She <span class='it'>was</span> too late—too late for her purpose,
which had been to forewarn her lover in season for
his escape. She was drifting toward the spot where
the river, at full seasons, made across the low neck
by which the promontory of “Bear Castle” was
united with the main land. Her paddle no longer
dipt the water, but was employed solely to protect
her from the overhanging branches beneath which
she now prepared to steer. It was at her approach
to this point, that she was suddenly roused to apprehension
by the ominous warning chant set up by the
African.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Brough! what can they be doing with
him?” was her question to herself. But the next
moment she discovered that his howl was meant to
be a hymn; and the peculiar volume which the negro
gave to his utterance, led her to divine its import.
There was little time allowed her for reflection. A
moment after, and just when her boat was abreast
of the bayou which Dunbar and his men were required
to cross in penetrating the place of refuge, she
heard the sudden pistol shooting under which Coulter
had fallen. With a heart full of terror, trembling
with anxiety and fear, Frederica had the strength
of will to remain quiet for the present. Seizing upon
an overhanging bough, she lay concealed within the
shadow of the copse until the loyalists had rushed
across the bayou, and were busy, with lighted torches,
exploring <a id='the'></a>the thickets. She had heard the bugle
of Coulter sounded as he was about to fall, after
being wounded, and her quick consciousness readily
enabled her to recognize it as her lover’s. But she
had heard no movement afterward in the quarter
from which came the blast, and could not conceive
that he should have made his way to join his comrades
in the space of time allowed between that and
the moment when she heard them taking to the river
with their horses. This difficulty led to new fears,
which were agonizing enough, but not of a sort to
make her forgetful of what was due to the person
whom she came to save. She waited only until the
torrent had passed the straits—until the bayou was
silent—when she fastened her little boat to the willows
which completely enveloped her, and boldly
stepped upon the land. With a rare instinct which
proved how deeply her heart had interested itself in
the operations of her senses, she moved directly to
the spot whence she had heard the bugle-note of her
lover. The place was not far distant from the point
where she had been in lurking. Her progress was
arrested by the prostrate trunk of a great cypress,
which the hurricane might have cast down some
fifty years before. It was with some difficulty that
she scrambled over it; but while crossing it she heard
a faint murmur, like the voice of one in pain, laboring
to speak or cry aloud. Her heart misgave
her. She hurried to the spot. Again the murmur—now
certainly a moan. It is at her feet, but on the
opposite side of the cypress, which she again crosses.
The place was very dark, and in the moment when,
from loss of blood, he was losing consciousness,
Richard Coulter had carefully crawled close to the
cypress, whose bulk, in this way, effectually covered
him from passing footsteps. She found him, still
warm, the flow of blood arrested, and his consciousness
returning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Richard! it is me—Frederica!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He only sighed. It required but an instant for reflection
on the part of the damsel; and rising from
the place where she had crouched beside him, she
darted away to the upper grounds where Brough
still continued to pour out his dismal ejaculations—now
of psalms and song, and now of mere whoop,
halloo, and imprecation. A full heart and a light
foot make quick progress when they go together.
It was necessary that Frederica should lose no time.
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
She had every reason to suppose that, failing to
secure their prey, the tories would suffer no delay in
the thicket. Fortunately, the continued cries of
Brough left her at no time doubtful of his whereabouts.
She soon found him, fastened to his tree, in
a state sufficiently uncomfortable for one whose ambition
did not at all incline him to martyrdom of any
sort. Yet martyrdom was now his fear. His first
impulses, which had given the alarm to the patriots,
were succeeded by feelings of no pleasant character.
He had already had a taste of Dunbar’s punishments,
and he dreaded still worse at his hands. The feeling
which had changed his howl of warning into one of
lament—his whoop into a psalm—was one accordingly
of preparation. He was preparing himself, as
well as he could, after his African fashion, for the
short cord and the sudden shrift, from which he had
already so narrowly escaped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing could exceed the fellow’s rejoicing as he
became aware of the character of his new visiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Misses! Da’s you? Loose ’em! Cut you’
nigger loose! Let ’em run! Sich a run! you nebber
see de like! I take dese woods, dis yer night, Mat
Dunbar nebber see me ’gen long as he lib! Ha! ha!
Cut! cut, misses! cut quick! de rope is work into
my berry bones!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no knife, Brough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No knife! Da’s wha’ woman good for! No hab
knife! Take you teet’, misses—gnaw de rope.
Psho! wha’ I tell you? Stop! Put you’ han’ in dis
yer pocket—you fin’ knife, if I no loss ’em in de run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knife was found, the rope cut, the negro free,
all in much less time than we have taken for the narration;
and hurrying the African with her, Frederica
was soon again beside the person of her lover. To
assist Brough in taking him upon his back, to help
sustain the still partially insensible man in this position
until he could be carried to the boat, was a work
of quick resolve, which required, however, considerable
time for performance. But patience and
courage, when sustained by love, become wonderful
powers; and Richard Coulter, whose moans increased
with his increasing sensibility, was finally laid down
in the bottom of the dug-out, his head resting in the
lap of Frederica. The boat could hold no more.
The faithful Brough, pushing her out into the stream,
with his hand still resting on stern or gunwale, swam
along with her, as she quietly floated with the currents.
We have seen the narrow escape which the little
vessel had as she rounded the headland below, just
as Dunbar came down upon the beach. Had he been
there when the canoe first began to round the point,
it would have been easy to have captured the whole
party, since the stream, somewhat narrow at this
place, set in for the shore which the tories occupied,
and a stout swimmer might have easily drawn the
little argosy upon the banks.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>To one familiar with the dense swamps that skirt
the rivers through the alluvial bottom lands of the
South, there will be no difficulty in comprehending
the fact that a fugitive may find temporary security
within half a mile of his enemy, even where his
pursuers hunt for him in numbers. Thus it happened
that, in taking to the river, our little corporal’s
guard of patriots, under the direction of Elijah Fields,
the worthy preacher, swimming their horses round
a point of land on the opposite shore, sought shelter
but a little distance below “Bear Island,” in a similar
tract of swamp and forest, and almost within rifle-shot
of their late retreat. They had no fear that
their enemy would attempt, at that late hour, and
after the long fatigue of their recent march and search,
to cross the river in pursuit of them; and had they
been wild enough to do so, it was equally easy to
hide from search, or to fly from pursuit. Dunbar
felt all this as sensibly as the fugitives; and with the
conviction of his entire failure at “Bear Castle,” he
gave up the game for the present. Meanwhile, the
little <a id='barq'></a>barque of Frederica Sabb made its way down the
river. She made her calculations on a just estimate
of the probabilities in the situation of Coulter’s party,
and was not deceived. As the boat swept over to
the opposite shore, after rounding the point of land
that lay between it and “Bear Castle,” it was hailed
by Fields, for whom Brough had a ready answer.
Some delay, the fruit of a proper caution, took place
before our fugitives were properly sensible of the
character of the stranger; but the result was, that
with returning consciousness, Richard Coulter found
himself once more in safety with his friends, and, a
still more precious satisfaction, attended by the woman
of his heart. It was not long before all the adventures
of Frederica were in his possession, and
his spirit became newly strengthened for conflict and
endurance by such proofs of a more than feminine
attachment which the brave young girl had shown.
Let us leave the little party for a season, while we
return with the captain of loyalists to the farmstead
of old Frederick Sabb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mat Dunbar had again taken up his quarters
as before, but with a difference. Thoroughly enraged
at his disappointment, and at the discovery that
Frederica had disappeared—a fact which produced
as much disquiet in the minds of her parents, as
vexation to her tory lover; and easily guessing at all
of the steps which she had taken, and of her object,
he no longer imposed any restraints upon his native
brutality of temper, which, while he had any hope
of winning her affections, he had been at some pains
to do. His present policy seemed to be to influence
her fears. To reach her heart, or force her inclinations,
through the dangers of her parents, was now
his object. Unfortunately, the lax discipline of the
British authority, in Carolina particularly, in behalf
of their own followers, enabled him to do much toward
this object, and without peril to himself. He
had anticipated the position in which he now found
himself, and had provided against it. He had obtained
from Col. Nesbett Balfour, the military commandant
of Charleston, a grant of the entire farmstead
of old Sabb—the non-committalism of the old Dutchman
never having enabled him to satisfy the British
authorities that he was a person deserving their protection.
Of the services and loyalty of Dunbar, on
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
the contrary, they were in possession of daily evidence.
It was with indescribable consternation that
old Sabb looked upon the massive parchment, sealed,
signed, and made authoritative by stately phrases
and mysterious words, of the purport of which he
could only conjecture, with which the fierce Dunbar
denounced him as a traitor to the king, and expelled
him from his own threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! mein Gott!” was his exclamation. “And
did the goot King Tshorge make dat baber? And
has de goot King Tshorge take away my grants?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only answer to this pitiful appeal vouchsafed
him by the captain of loyalists was a brutal oath, as
he smote the document fiercely with his hand, and
forbade all further inquiry. It may have been with
some regard to the probability of his future marriage—in
spite of all—with the old Dutchman’s daughter,
that he permitted him, with his wife, to occupy an
old log-house which stood upon the estate. He
established himself within the dwelling-house, which
he occupied as a garrisoned post with all his soldiers.
Here he ruled as a sovereign. The proceeds of the
farm were yielded to him, the miserable pittance excepted
which he suffered to go to the support of the
old couple. Sabb had a few slaves, who were now
taught to recognise Dunbar as their master. They
did not serve him long. Three of them escaped to
the woods the night succeeding the tory’s usurpation,
and but two remained in his keeping, rather,
perhaps, through the vigilance of his sentinels, and
their own fears, than because of any love which they
entertained for their new custodian. Both of these
were women, and one of them no less a person than
the consort of Brough, the African. Mrs. Brough—or,
as we had better call her, she will understand us
better—<span class='it'>Mimy</span>, (the diminutive of Jemima,) was particularly
watched, as through her it was hoped to
get some clue to her husband, whose treachery it
was the bitter resolution of our tory captain to punish,
as soon as he had the power, with exemplary tortures.
Brough had some suspicions of this design,
which it was no part of his policy to assist; but this
did not discourage him from an adventure which
brought him again very nearly into contact with his
enemy. He determined to visit his wife by stealth,
relying upon his knowledge of the woods, his own
caution, and the thousand little arts with which his
race usually takes advantage of the carelessness, the
indifference, or the ignorance of its superior. His
wife, he well knew, conscious of his straits, would
afford him assistance in various ways. He succeeded
in seeing her just before the dawn of day one morning,
and from her discovered the whole situation of
affairs at the farmstead. This came to him with
many exaggerations, particularly when Mimy described
the treatment to which old Sabb and his wife
had been subjected. It did not lose any of its facts
or dimensions, when carried by Brough to the fugitives
in the swamp forests of Edisto. The news
was of a character to overwhelm the affectionate and
dutiful heart of Frederica Sabb. She instantly felt
the necessity before her, and prepared herself to encounter
it. Nine days and nights had she spent in
the forest retreats of her lover. Every tenderness
and forbearance had been shown her. Nothing had
taken place to outrage the delicacy of the female
heart, and pure thoughts in her mind had kept her
free from any annoying doubts about the propriety
of her situation. A leafy screen from the sun, a
sylvan bower of broad branches and thickly thatched
leaves, had been prepared for her couch at night;
and, in one contiguous, lay her wounded lover. His
situation had amply reconciled her to her own. His
wound was neither deep nor dangerous. He had
bled copiously, and swooned rather in consequence
of loss of blood than from the severity of his pains.
But the hands of Elijah Field—a rough but not wholly
inexperienced surgeon, had bound up his hurts, which
were thus permitted to heal from the first intention.
The patient was not slow to improve, though so
precious sweet had been his attendance—Frederica
herself, like the damsels of the feudal ages, assisting
to dress his wound, and tender him with sweetest
nursing, that he felt almost sorry at the improvement
which, while lessening his cares, lessened her
anxieties. Our space will not suffer us to dwell
upon the delicious scenes of peace and love which
the two enjoyed together in these few brief days of
mutual dependence. They comprised an age of immeasurable
felicity, and brought the two together in
bonds of sympathy, which, however large had been
their love before, now rendered the passion more than
ever at home and triumphant in their mutual hearts.
But with the tidings of the situation in which her
parents suffered, and the evident improvement of her
lover, the maiden found it necessary to depart from
their place of hiding—that sweet security of shade,
such as the fancy of youth always dreams of, but
which it is the lot of very few to realise. She took
her resolution promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must leave you, Richard. I must go home to
my poor mother, now that she is homeless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would, if he could, have dissuaded her from
venturing herself within the reach of one so reckless
and brutal as Mat Dunbar. But his sense of right
seconded her resolution, and though he expressed
doubts and misgivings, and betrayed his uneasiness
and anxiety, he had no arguments to offer against
her purpose. She heard him with a sweet smile,
and when he had finished, she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I will give you one security, dear Richard,
before we part, if you will suffer me. You would
have married me more than a year ago; but as I
knew my father’s situation, his preferences, and his
dangers, I refused to do so until the war was over.
It has not helped him that I refused you then. I
don’t see that it will hurt him if I marry you now;
and there is something in the life we have spent together
the last few days, that tells me we ought to
be married, Richard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was spoken with the sweetest possible blush
upon her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you consent, then, dear Frederica?” demanded
the enraptured lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her hand into his own; he carried it to his
lips, then drew her down to him where he lay upon
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
his leafy couch, and repeated the same liberty with
hers. His shout, in another moment, summoned
Elijah Field to his side. The business in prospect
was soon explained. Our good parson readily concurred
in the propriety of the proceeding. The inhabitants
of the little camp of refuge were soon
brought together, Brough placing himself directly
behind his young mistress. The white teeth of the
old African grinned his approbation; the favoring
skies looked down upon it, soft in the dreamy twilight
of the evening sunset; and there, in the natural
temple of the forest—none surely ever prouder or
more appropriate—with columns of gigantic pine and
cypress, and a gothic luxuriance of vine, and leaf,
and flower, wrapping shaft, and cornice, capital and
shrine, our two lovers were united before God—our
excellent preacher never having a more solemn or
grateful sense of the ceremony, and never having
been more sweetly impressive in his manner of performing
it. It did not impair the validity of the
marriage that Brough honored it, as he would probably
have done his own, by dancing <span class='it'>Juba</span>, for a
full hour after it was over, to his own satisfaction at
least, and in the absence of all other witnesses.
Perhaps, of all his little world, there were none
whom the old negro loved quite so much, white or
black, as his young mistress and her youthful husband.
With the midnight, Frederica left the camp
of refuge under the conduct of Elijah Fields. They
departed in the boat, the preacher pulling up stream—no
easy work against a current of four knots—with
a vigorous arm, which, after a tedious space, brought
him to the landing opposite old Sabb’s farm. Here
Frederica landed, and the dawn of day found her
standing in front of the old log-house which had been
assigned her parents, and a captive in the strict
custody of the tory sentries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is part of the popular belief, I know, that our
ancestors, of three centuries back, lived and talked
in quite a different fashion from mankind at the present
day; but as I entertain no political designs on
that <span class='sc'>Great Caioled</span>, the people, I may venture to
assert an opinion of my own. I cannot persuade
myself what is called human nature has undergone
much alteration in the exchange of an iron for a
broadcloth suit, and it is very certain people ate,
drank, and slept in those remote times much as we
now do, although your stilted romancers seldom recognise
the fact, and make their heroines as unlike
tangible women, “not too good for daily food,” as
their heroes are exemplars of the mendacious gifts
of their biographers. In the matter of speech, through
which we mainly receive impressions of fictitious
personages, it is extraordinary what fustian is
palmed on a credulous posterity, as the veritable
domestic talk of nobles, knights and folks of lesser
condition. There is no comedy, high or low, in the
conceptions of many of these authors; Man having
apparently assumed the distinguishing trait of a
laughing animal, or at best of an humorous one, at
some more recent epoch of modern history. Every
body struts about in buskins and speaks tragedy,
nothing less; and as to the fooleries enacted by
pages, grooms, and servitors of all kinds, there is no
end to them, nor any like nowadays, except we find
it on the boards of a country theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What I say admits of easy illustration. Thus,
when the page woke Don Pedro out of his morning
nap—which, by the bye, he was taking not as the
usual impression is, in greaves and a casque—he,
the page, did not “lout low as it behooves trusty
varlets” to do, but in a manner as straight-forward
as a modern Thomas would employ, gave the
drowsy knight to understand that some one had been
sounding his horn at the gate for the last half hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” returned the master, turning over
to resume his doze where he was interrupted—the
gate being the concern of the warder, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Sir Peter,” put in the page, by way of remonstrance,
“it is mi señora who has sent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah ha!” cried the knight, suddenly becoming
wide awake, and leaning on both elbows in bed to
regard the speaker. “Well, what message does
she send?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That she wishes you to come up to the castle
as soon as your comfort allows, as she has something
special to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will, presently,” exclaimed Don Pedro,
getting up so promptly his gaunt figure showed to
no advantage in its scant costume. “And so tell
Gil, or whoever came, to carry back word. How
the dear lady talks of comfort to a man accustomed
to the ease of camps! Fetch me those things, Iorge,
and look behind the arras for my slashed doublet.
Stop, before you go, reach down my sword and
spurs from the hook behind the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now all this is very rational, much like what one
would say at the present date, and unless the Spanish
version of my story was never written, (which the
Muse of veracity—whatever her name—it was not
Clio, I know—forbid!) was the identical language
employed on the occasion by my hero, as true a
knight as Spain has produced since her Cid Rodrigo.
This reminds me a hero of romance cannot be passed
over as commoner folks, with a surmise as to his
inches and the color of his hair, and moreover is
expected to be an Apollo in shape, and sort of supernatural
in virtues, provided his character is not cast
in quite a different mould, and dependent for admiration
on the enormity of its crimes. But Don Pedro,
unfortunately for the interest his fortunes are destined
to excite, fell into neither extreme, was neither a
saint nor a monster of iniquity, and as far from being
handsome as from being deformed. To have designated
him in a crowd, you would have called
attention to his overtopping the rest by a full head,
or to a certain sinewy spareness of limb, or else the
simplicity of his toilet, at a time when country gentlemen
wore ribbons and gewgaws alternately with
steel harness. But closer, the irregularity of his features,
browned by the sun where the rim of the
casque had not interposed, was compensated for by
the singularly calm beauty of his eyes, which, in
their serene intelligence, would have become the
brows of any woman, and even in battle shone with
a high sort of exultation, such as one would attribute
to a victorious angel in the celestial wars. There
was nothing about Don Pedro which harmonized
with these eyes, except, perhaps, an undertone of
gentleness pervading his voice; it was an undertone
only, for nothing womanish characterized his speech,
no mincing of words or <a id='mait'></a>petit-maître modulations in
addressing the other sex: there was not a particle
of affectation in the man, because there was not a
particle of untruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think it was these same fine eyes and gentleness
which first won the heart of the lady Hermosa, and
his sincerity that safely kept it. Of where and how
they first met, in what words our Don laid his little
keep of a castle and patrimony at her feet, (his whole
estate would not have paid her upholsterer’s bill,)
history discloses nothing. It is only known she married
him, and thereby raised a tempest of wrath and
despair in the breasts of numberless admirers, who,
however, all consented to eat of her cake on the
happy occasion. Sir Peter was in nothing changed
by the event, but lived as before in his tower, spent
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
not a <span class='it'>maravedi</span> of his wife’s income on himself, and
contented her by the frequency and tenderness of
his interviews. It was his whim to lead this style
of life, and she loved him enough to soon make it a
whim of her own, the separations not being very
remote it must be conceded, as the keep and castle
stood perched on opposing hills, in full sight of one
another. Such concession in a young wife was certainly
praiseworthy, although some were found to
be scandalized at its want of precedent. Of the husband’s
crotchet I say only, it was a quaint piece of
instinctive honor, which a few of his neighbors extolled,
and the greater part laughed at as an act of
arrant simplicity: although, to my mind, the less
said about simplicity the better, by people who lived
when dragons and giants were not yet supposed to
have retired upon ultimate Thule, and Ponce de
Leon’s search after the fountain of youth, (he was
looking for it then in Florida!) counted no great
waste of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Don and his countess concerned themselves
very little about such gossip, finding abundant occupation
in a course of life which, without the bias
one unavoidably entertains for his heroes, is a source
of satisfaction to the writer hereof. It was in the
lady’s nature to be charitable, being one of those unaffected
well wishers of humanity with “abundant
means,” whose part in this life seems to be to render
everybody in reach as satisfied as themselves, and
before Sir Pedro’s discretion and mature knowledge
of the world came to her assistance, committed as
many philanthropic blunders as would have made
her eligible to an abolition chair, or seat in Exeter
Hall. Of course I must not be understood to undervalue
the good she continued to do in the dark. I
have too great a reverence for money to suppose it
capable of injury to any recipient under any circumstances,
differing in this respect from all medicines
whatever, which become poisons in quantity, and
are defective in the important item of universal application.
The truth is, I am led to this admission
by an instance I have now in mind. There was one
Don Carlo, (so he called himself: the fellow had a
dog’s name, but any dog, short of a sheep-worrier,
would have been compromised by his acquaintance.)
A free-captain, who earned his crust by such little
excesses as made the payment of black-mail an acceptable
compromise on the part of his favorites, and
even in Philip the Second’s time, brought an amount
of civil odium upon his head which would have relieved
him of that incumbrance, had he not disbanded
his company and retired to the provinces to enjoy
his honest gains. Here Captain Carlo—who was of
a playful temper and delighted in masking—made
the acquaintance of our heroine in the likeness of a
veteran of the Moorish wars, and found waylaying
her steps and asking an alms as many times a day
as she walked out unattended (in as many different
characters, of course,) so much more profitable, to
say nothing of the safety of the proceeding, than
poniarding a foot-passenger, or roasting a villager
to discover hidden treasure, that he became a pattern
of morality to the country round, and is currently
said to have refrained more than once, when sorely
tempted by the purse she carried, from cutting his
benefactress’ slender throat; in this respect showing
himself wiser than the avaricious owner of the goose
Æsop tells us of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Carlo, however, lost his golden eggs, as
did many others of scarcely less merit, when Sir
Pedro de Padilh brought, as has been hinted, his
longer head and more comprehensive benevolence to
the aid of his young wife’s virtuous designs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter quickly saw her mistake when once its
results were laid bare, and fell to correcting it with
a feminine energy which constituted a strong element
of her character; Sir Peter meanwhile contenting
himself with a vigilant guardianship of her
interests and benevolent projects, and a hearty participation
in her active measures—suggestions of his
own, not unfrequently too—which it was his fancy
to conceal under an assumption of caution; although
I can’t say his wife was ever deceived by the cloak
worn on such occasions, for her tender affection
would have lent intelligence to faculties much duller
than my heroine’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Pedro very well knew it was some such work
ahead which brought a summons to his gate so early,
and was in his saddle, breathing in the fresh, moist
air, and galloping through the fields and olive plantations
between, before Gil reached his lady’s castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I see the good knight now in my mind’s eye: Andalusian
steed and housings both spotless white, the
first as much over the average height of his race as
was his master above that of common men: sitting
straight, with doublet buttoned easily across the
breast, and a cap with a trailing plume, which a
branch caught off and forced him to wheel his horse,
with a <span class='it'>gracias señor</span>, to recover: so, picking a way
up the hill, and stooping under the portcullis, ready
open, diminishing the stature of the men around by
contrast with his figure dismounted. Up the wide
steps, and into a room where his countess met him
with her usual happy face whenever this giant of a
husband was nigh her. Perhaps I call attention too
often to Sir Peter’s seven feet of altitude, but in this
case the mention was involuntary; for I was thinking
how, when she put her arms about him, there
being no one near, she was constrained to kiss him
where she laid her cheek, on his breast, being able
to reach no higher; and he, as a pine might an ash
in windy weather, stooped and kissed her on the
forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady mine,” he said with a grave smile, holding
her off to look down in her face, “what is the matter?
You were scarcely more troubled when I rode
against the Moors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Señor—husband”—she replied, “what I have to
tell may induce you to leave me again. It is that
troubles me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” returned the knight, “a crusade
against something or somebody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered the countess, “one full of danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Don Pedro smiled as a soldier of his inches, of
course, should at the idea of the thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
“A week ago, my cousin Vida Inique came to
me in much distress. You remember her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly! She is the betrothed, Heaven help
her, of that vagabond nephew of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She stopped here, for she came from Madrid
with that purpose; partly because she needs sympathy
now, and I am her nearest relative, and partly
for the sake of society during the absence of her
father with the Marquis of Santa Cruz.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Santa Cruz!” repeated the Don, with the animation
of his Andalusian snuffing a whiff of cannon
smoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The king has ordered an armament under
the marquis against Tercera.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word of this reached me in the mountains.
A handful of good knights would drive every Portuguese
into the sea; I wonder the marquis sails against
such enemies, when he complained only the other
day of their ill breeding in Portugal; there was scarce
a skirmish in which their backs were not turned
upon their Spanish guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will think differently, my señor, when I tell
you all; but let me tell it as I heard it. Doña Viola
wept so incessantly at first, whenever she attempted
to allude to Hilo—for, of course, he is the cause of her
grief—that I could understand nothing. The silly
girl loves him with her soul and heart, and pretty
and wealthy as she is, this half nephew of yours
feels the yoke of his connection intolerable, and has
adopted the most outrageous means of extorting her
consent to canceling the agreement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! what mischief has he been doing lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, when his representations and contemptuous
reception of her fond prayers failed to gain his purpose,
he insulted her eyes by parading before them
on all occasions his companions, the most notorious
thieves and desperadoes of the capital, and women
of the vilest character, flaunting, not unfrequently, in
chains and baubles he had stooped to accept but
never to wear, for the boy is as proud and wicked as
Lucifer; all this done with a scornful, overbearing
air, which plainly said, ‘these, madam, are my intimate
friends; they will sit at your table and fill
your house when I am master. Beware how you
make me so!’ She is so subdued and heart-broken
already, she only wept and endeavored to hide his
insults from her father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Santiago! what infatuation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then his vile nature broke forth still more insolently.
His birth, as you know, gives him access
to the company of numerous dissolute cavaliers,
although the society he usually affects is of a much
baser sort. Through their means, without other
harm to himself than what is in store for his lying
tongue, señor, he poisoned her life by spreading
through all ranks tales in which her maiden name
was coupled with that of infamy, and when this
gossip was in the mouth of everybody, flung her off
publicly with a show of horror and mental anguish,
which probably had its weight on those who knew
nothing of the man’s character.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Pedro’s brows contracted above his fine eyes,
but he remained silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scandal reached at last the ears of Don
Augustino Inique himself, in Portugal, and hastening
from the frontier to the court, he laid the
matter before the king, demanding redress. Unluckily,
this was not until he had exhausted every
source of information in tracing the flight of the young
man, who had stabbed the Count of Villenos in a
quarrel in the meanwhile, and disappeared from the
city. Don Philip loves to be called the Prudent, and
has no fancy for being second in any intrigue, and
accordingly the enraged and baffled father was dismissed
with polite promises that meant nothing.
Since then he has received secret intelligence that
Hilo has gone over to France, and either through
unnatural hatred of his countrymen, or characteristic
recklessness of every honorable purpose—for he is
capable of any degradation—enlisted under the commander,
De Chaste, who sails soon at the bidding of
the queen mother to reinforce the Tercerans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why he is more depraved than his father, and
he scrupled at little when his passions were roused!”
exclaimed Sir Pedro, baiting suddenly in a walk
which crossed the chamber at six strides. “This
man is only my half relative, as his father was, and
does not even bear my name; but I must save him
from final ruin if that be possible. What steps have
been taken by Inique?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He readily obtained the appointment of camp-master
under the marquis, as no one at court knew
his motive, and supposed he went abroad to find
forgetfulness in active service. A singular feature
in the affair, is his ignorance of Hilo’s relation to
yourself; and although Viola is acquainted with its
existence, the chief defect in her character, a timid
reluctance to confiding any personal matter to her
father, has prevented his learning the truth during
his brief visits to his home. Yet a more gentle nature
I have never found than hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I scarcely wonder at her shrinking from opening
her heart to Don Augustino,” answered our knight,
“and were you to see him frequently, you would
entertain a like opinion. He is a soldier, and nothing
better if nothing worse—stern, scrupulous of his
word, and jealous of his honor; although what he
calls by that name is of no wide compass; a man
whose outbreak of rage against his daughter I would
have awaited with strong apprehension, had I known
any thing of this affair before. Perhaps, however,
the purpose of swift vengeance so occupies his brain
that feebler emotions is pushed aside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are right, Sir Pedro,” returned his
lady, thoughtfully. “For during the short space he
remained with us, he seemed pre-occupied, as if
tracing a single idea through a maze of thought, and
spoke little of his own accord. His bearing was
frigid enough, but if any unjust anger toward his
child remained, it was well concealed under the
elaborate courtesy he shared between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said the knight, with a half laugh. “His
old way, I recollect it well; never more labored
than when a volcano is smouldering under his doublet.
Only once have I seen him forgetful of this courtesy,
when his son, a mere stripling, and a coward by instinct,
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
as others are brave without will of their own,
in a skirmish with the French sheltered himself behind
his father in sight of the opposing lines. He
was his only son, but he had better have been thrust
through by a Gallic lance, than taken refuge where
he did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow! Did Sir Augustino strike him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worse. His boy was on foot, himself on horseback;
when his threats and imprecations failed to
drive him back into the melee, in a paroxysm of fury
he struck him repeatedly on the head with the pommel
of his sword, unsoftened by the fair, bleeding
face the child turned up while clutching his leg,
and begging for life. Not a gentleman in the two
armies sympathised with the father except Capt. De
Chaste, who, incapable of a like barbarity, is noted
for pushing to an extreme all questions of honor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was scarcely less cruel than Beaumanoir,
who cried, ‘Bois ton sang,’ to his fainting son,” exclaimed
Doña Hermosa, with a cheek paled by the
recital. “Did the poor lad die?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He lived by an accident, or Providence,
which you will, a miserable idiot, his brain having
been injured by the concussion, perhaps, also by the
anguish endured. Sir Augustino takes him with him,
no matter where he goes, studiously bent on concealing
his existence, much more his presence from
his companions in arms. In spite of every precaution,
however, the fact is well known; and twice
this wreck of a man has eluded his keeper, and appeared
suddenly in the midst of the knight’s guests.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was his father much moved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, very little in appearance, his usual proud
composure concealing whatever pang he felt; and it
is impossible to ascertain from his manner whether
he adheres to this strange companionship from remorse,
and a resolute purpose of atonement, or a less
worthy desire to smother the reproach by a jealous
guardianship of its living witness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or else, dear señor, from a return of natural tenderness
which a false shame prevents him acknowledging
for so mean an object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why some share of good belongs to every man;
even it may be, to my next of kin, although warped
by the supremacy of his passions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the only sane argument Viola advances
for her love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Humph!” After an interval; “I would like to
see the Doña, if only to remove the impression that
she is no higher than this chair, as she was when I
saw her some years since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find her,” rejoined the countess, smiling,
“less a child in height and style than her youth
would lead you to suppose; for a comparatively
self-dependent life in close vicinity to the court, has
already converted girlish bashfulness into a becoming
modesty enough. But stay here till I find her,”
added Doña Hermosa, going out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wretched state of things,” mused our knight,
resuming his suspended strides, with hands clasped
behind. “It is evident I have but one course left;
to track that young knave down, and by dint of soft
or hard words, turn him from a career which has
already entitled him to a bench in the galleys, if nothing
worse. It is a good way, at all events, to pay
back the bitter hatred of his father, God forgive
him!” and the soldier’s moody brows relaxed at the
thought, while his eye ran down the steep road at
the foot of which the father of the man he designed
saving, had one evening shattered his carbine on the
rocks, because its hanging-fire saved Sir Pedro’s life
in passing. A quiet smile, called up, perhaps, by a
recollection of the solicitude shown by the countess
the day succeeding, still lingered about the knight’s
mouth when he turned from the window and saw
the lady herself approaching, accompanied by her
guest, a fair girl, with the light, soft hair and eyes
of an Englishwoman, which her mother was. Her
beauty appeared less imposing than that of the
thoroughly Spanish Hermosa, but much more delicate,
and so Sir Pedro seemed to think, for advancing
and taking her by both hands, he said, in a tone
much more modulated than was common with him,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doña Viola—I called you Viola when we last
met, and you were no taller than my sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call me so now, señor,” put in Viola, gently. “I
cannot afford to lose even the wording of friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight looked attentively at the speaker,
whose eyes meeting his, swam in tears. He
paused thoughtfully, and then with his usual straight-forward
kindness, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, I have learned your grievances through
your cousin here. You are nearly alone in the world,
let us both assist you in all we can. You see I am
old enough to be your father, think of me as such for
the present. Besides, the cavalier whose <a id='fian'></a>fiancée
you are, is, you know, my half nephew; and the
attempt I am about making to draw him from his
wicked courses, will be materially assisted by any
good traits I may become acquainted with; for
while I confess my ignorance of the better side of
his character, Doña Viola, I am sure one exists, or
you would not have proved so faithful as you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint red spot in the girl’s cheek had deepened
and spread as Sir Pedro spoke, until at his last
words, her whole face was flushed, and stooping
quickly, she pressed her lips on his hand before he
could withdraw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” she said, eagerly to Padilh, who
stood with something like a blush on his soldierly
features at the impulsive action. “Save him from
himself, from his temptations, for he has a virtue
mated with every vice he practices, and ready to
assume its place when the bad is uprooted. I know,”
she added, with an impetuous accent which betrayed
her Spanish blood, and was singularly impressive in
her timid manner of speaking, “he is a professed
gambler, yet I have seen him clothe and feed a company
of beggars with the lavish generosity of a
prince; I know he has repeatedly endeavored to rescind
our contract of marriage, but how should this
bind his love, since we were infants when it was
drawn in our joint name; and I have no reason,
surely, to complain that he has employed harsh means
to accomplish his end, when I shut my eyes to the
growth of his aversion. No, Sir Pedro, the fault has
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
been mine in tempting him on; no one can say how
different his life might have been, but for the incumbrance
I would not consent to his putting away—and
so let me suffer, not him. Save him, I earnestly
beseech you, from himself, and if need be,” she
added, dropping her voice, and becoming as suddenly
pallid as before flushed, “save him from an
encounter with my father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I will,” returned the Don, soothingly, “if
interposition of my words or body can. And one of
these days, Doña Viola, we will talk these matters
over calmly, and discuss what is best to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor thing is crazed,” he said an hour after
to his countess, “to love this Hilo! It was not easy
to bring my mouth to call the scamp ‘cavalier;’ but
her innocent distress overcame the reluctance. When
this feverish excitement, which forbids all close
questioning, subsides, it will be well to learn more,
if she knows more of her betrothed. And if I set out
before that can be done—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, do you really go to this war!” exclaimed
our heroine, with the admirable versatility of the
sex, “when you have resigned yourself to the gratification
of a particular request not at all to your liking
at first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dear</span>, Sir Pedro, don’t you think some better
way may be found of accomplishing our purpose?
For instance, let some trusty person find out this
young man and carry him a letter from you, as from
an uncle solicitous of doing him a benefit. Or, perhaps,
Señor Inique might be moved from his design
by your calm representations. Only don’t go!” she
urged, with a tremulous lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this outbreak Don Pedro de Padilh, with the
tranquillity of one who remembers a story he is
anxious to tell and overlooks the last question, rejoined,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever hear, Hermosa, the history of the
wonderful cat that lived in Biscay when I was of
no great size myself? There is one of the tribe
on the battlement yonder, marked as that intelligent
animal must have been, and put the story
in my head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!” said the countess, half inclined to laugh,
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This cat was remarkable for ugliness and cunning,
qualities which increased the umbrage the
priest naturally took to a cat who was said to use
better Latin than himself, to that degree he could
not rest at ease until the object of his jealousy was
condemned to be burned, on the rational plea of possessing
more learning than was orthodox. But so
sagacious a creature was not to be caught asleep,
and at the first rumor of the affair took occasion to
pay his respects to the most notorious gossip of the
province.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Ah!’ said the cat, in the course of conversation,
“‘talking of merit, I am so delighted to find it
rewarded occasionally, that I have been in a state
of ecstasy since the news came from the capital.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Santomio!’ cried the old woman <span class='it'>arrectis auribus</span>;
‘what are they doing there, my dear cat?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Have you not heard about it! Our curà is to
be rewarded with a bishopric instanter; and for my
part I don’t think a better selection possible, when
his scholarship is taken into consideration, and I
have some cause to count myself a judge of such
matters.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Yes, yes, Señor Miz,’ put in the other. ‘But
this is important news to be sure; I hope you have
it from good authority.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘None better. My sister’s grandkitten is attached
to the household of the cardinal resident, and has
just come down to pay me a visit. Trust to my
honor, señora most respected, you may talk of it
without fear for your veracity.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, this was all sheer invention on the
part of the cat, but served his purpose for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why did not the foolish cat slip quietly away
beforehand?” asked the countess, who began to feel
an interest in his fortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, because the <span class='it'>familiars</span> on watch were too
alert, I suppose. But hear what followed. When
the curà, who had been on a <a id='litt'></a>little expedition to bargain
for the faggots, returned to his house, he was
charmed to learn his approaching exaltation from a
score of friends; and at this juncture, being seized
with remorse at his precipitation, resolved to hear
from the cat’s own mouth the state of his faith.
‘For,’ said he to himself, as he tucked up his cassock
and waded through the mud to the latter’s door,
‘one should not burn a Christian beast by mistake;
and who knows what influence the grandkitten of his
very discreet sister may have in his eminence’s house.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Why,’ said the shrewd grimalkin, who saw in
a twinkling how much this last reason had to do with
the curà’s visit, ‘your reverend worship’s excellency
must perceive at a glance how this seam in
my upper lip forms a cross with the nostril above—a
sign which I need not inform your worship, is
found only on catholic quadrupeds.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Ha!’ cried the priest, struck with the idea, ‘so
it is. I beg your pardon, Señor Miz, for overlooking
it hitherto.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Not at all, the wisest sometimes err, as my
relative, the cardinal’s favorite, remarked to me
yesterday. I am glad your reverence was not
within hearing, for she was good enough to repeat
much of the praise his eminence bestows on your
worship, knowing she could not better please me.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In such amicable conversation time passed, until
the priest, bethinking himself that the preparations
for Autodafeïng his host, had gone too far to be
hushed up without some plausible excuse, and seeing
no way out of his dilemma, reluctantly confided his
difficulty to the party interested, for whom he began
to feel a very disinterested friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Make yourself easy,’ rejoined the other, scarcely
able to hide his satisfaction, ‘if that is the whole
difficulty, all your worship has to do is to fling my
<span class='it'>san-berito</span> (faugh! the name makes me hot and cold
all over!) into the fire, and give me a chance to
clutch your reverend legs, under your worship’s
gown.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘<span class='it'>To</span> be sure!’ said the curà, in a tone of benignant
admiration, which one should get Judge Belton,
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
or the Mayor of Aiken, (who got it from the Spanish
original,) to mimic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even the joint sagacity of a cat and a priest may
fall short of perfection. It was natural, certainly,
for the curà to dream all night of his expected mitre,
and allow the same agreeable subject to occupy his
brain all day to the exclusion of every other. But I
hold to it, that he should have remembered at the
right moment, (as he might easily have done, of
course, by tying a knot in his handkerchief or thread
round his finger,) to slip off the <span class='it'>san-berito</span>, and <span class='it'>not</span>
throw his unhappy friend into the fire. Why, but
for his confounded (I beg pardon, but one has their
feelings!) absence of mind, he might have seen his
victim’s tail—his head being smothered in the conical
<span class='it'>caroza</span>—as big as his arm, with rage and indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Wo is me!’ cried the wretched man, when he
saw what was done, tearing his beard in anguish of
mind, ‘I have burned a Christian cat, and lost my
mitre!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While saying the last words, Don Pedro, who had
been standing during the recital, took his cap and
moved to the door. But his countess intercepted
him with a wistful, half-perplexed face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said the knight, stopping, and looking at
her with a scarce visible smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” returned Hermosa, doubtingly, “you
mean I am no wiser than the curà, who, forgetting
what he was about, threw his friend into the fire,
and then fell to lamenting his loss. But who is
the cat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” rejoined Sir Pedro, laughing, “the pith of
the story lies in six words,</p>

<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Which make him imitate his God.</p>

<p class='dramaline-cont'>&ensp;&ensp;In the sunset of existence,</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Alone, in thy Gethsemane,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;Quaff the cup bravely and repine not—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For man, thy God is there with thee.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Meekly obey the mandate given,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It purifies thy soul for heaven.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>A strange thought that—childhood is Adam’s Eden,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where man beholds his Maker face to face;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The close of life is his Gethsemane,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where he must quaff the chalice to the dregs,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Without a prayer to take it from his lips.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I’ve heard that hymn before.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why call it strange?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The cup is sweetened though it smack of bitter,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the most bitter drops become the sweetest.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Gethsemane was nearer heaven with him</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who bathed with tears and blood the sacred soil,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Than fresh blown Paradise appears to have been</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With angel visitants. Perchance they are</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The self-same garden, typed by Spring and Autumn,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Seed-time and harvest! If that thought be true,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With bathed forelock and with steadfast soul</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Gather the harvest of Gethsemane,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>More precious than the flowers that smiled in Eden.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The task is thine—first husbandman, then reaper.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Talk further of the boy who sung the hymn.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>That spotless child, the rudest of the crew</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Loved, for his presence made us better men.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>True, all men who love children still grow better;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the best men are children to the last,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>At least in thought and feeling.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>There’s the circle—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Extremes must meet, and we are hedged within them.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But to pursue our voyage—and the boy.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Day <a id='past'></a>passed away, and as the night came on</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The full-orbed moon roiled in a cloudless sky,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And the wide waters now lay hushed in sleep.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As gentle as the slumber of a child</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Wearied with gambols through the live-long day.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The night-breeze from the orange-groves passed by,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Laden with odor. Heaven was chrisolite;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The sea a living mirror, in whose depths</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The richly studded concave was reflected,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Making a perfect globe; and as the ship</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Pursued her trackless flight, she seemed to be</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Some spirit on errand supernatural,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>So dark and silently she glided on</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The babbling waves were scarcely audible.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>A pleasant sail which landsmen only dream of—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But never enjoy.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>All joy hath bitterness.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stretched on the deck the sailor-boy reposed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And lived in dreams his infant years again.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The seamen, ’mid the shrouds aloft reclining,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Told o’er their tales of wreck and lingering death,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And in the drowsy interval was heard</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The rugged cadence of the helmsman’s song.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>“A pleasant sail!” But pleasure has strange wings,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She comes a zephyr and departs a whirlwind.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Kisses the flower to blooming, then destroys.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>Sudden the helmsman’s drowsy song was hushed.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A fearful cry arose—“The ship’s on fire!”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The seamen from aloft sent back the cry;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The sailor boy shook off his happy dream,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And woke to horror. All was wild dismay!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Half sleeping—half awake, the crew came forth;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Grim death, enveloped in his robes of flame,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Marched on and laughed. There was no human power</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To put aside his footstep. On he moved</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In awful majesty; whate’er he touched,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>True to its origin, returned to dust,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And Nature’s master-work, man’s godlike frame,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Became as worthless as the spars and sails,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Each made its pile of ashes—nothing more.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Ashes to ashes all, and dust to dust,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The self-same mandate both on earth and sea.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>The flames attained dominion. Tyrant-like,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>They ruled and raged. Upon the shrouds they seized,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Kissing destruction—laughing as they kissed;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>While the broad glare they spread upon the deep</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Changed the sea’s nature. Water soon became</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A lake of living fire. “A pleasant sail!”</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>You weep. Go on.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>O that I then had perished!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I seized the boy and leaped into the waves.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Upon a fallen spar we safely rode</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Until the ship went down. “A pleasant sail!”</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her knell one shriek of mortal agony.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>We had no heart to weep for their sad fate—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>No heart to pray for one less terrible.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I gathered fragments from the floating wreck,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And made a raft, where two immortal souls</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Struggled with time to check eternity</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With frail appliance. For three days we suffered;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And then a passing ship preserved our lives</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For greater suffering.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>The boy—his fate?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>His parents dead—the lad became my charge.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I then was married to a worthy woman—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>God’s kindest gift. We had an only child—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>My wife brought up the children as if twins,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And at a proper age he sailed with me.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He grew to manhood—noble—cheerful—kind</p>
<p class='dramaline'>As those who love the artless lips of children;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A very babe was he in his affections—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A very demon in his bitter passions.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The eagle and the dove oft make their nest—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The tiger and the ermin find a lair</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In the same bosom.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>What became of him?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>My wife grew sick. He loved her as his mother;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He loved my daughter too. I sailed, and left him</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To till my little ground and smooth their pathway.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>After three years I came to port again.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Crossing my fields, which now poured forth their increase,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I saw a man resting upon his plough,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Singing right lustily.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>What did he sing?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>In the noontide of existence,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With swarthy brow and rugged limb,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Man bravely struggles for subsistence</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For those in sin begot by him;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Rejoices in all frailties—sorrows,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They draw him nearer to his God.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>The hymn of early childhood still remembered.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>A bending in the chain to form the circle.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He led me to my home—and such a home!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>It seemed as if the fairies had been there</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Making their May-day—wife and daughter happy.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Then, from an arbor overgrown with flowers,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He placed a prattling child upon my knee,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And called him by my name. He laughed outright—</p>
<p class='dramaline'><span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>
<p class='dramaline'>My daughter blushed. They now were man and wife.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I danced—then blubbered like a very child.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Tears are at times a truer sign of joy</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Than smiles and laughter.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>&nbsp;’Twas a boy, you said?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>A boy—his bud of Paradise, he called him.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Such flowers, too, often yield most bitter fruit</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In man’s Gethsemane.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Thank God! not always.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>We dwelt together for a few brief months.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He then proposed to try the sea again,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To place the beings whom we fondly loved</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Beyond the cold calamities of earth.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Three years we sailed—we prospered, and returned</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With means to make those happy whom we loved.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On wearied pinions, like the dove of peace</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When land was found, he flew to seek the ark</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Where our best feelings day and night reposed,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>While struggling with the ocean. God! O God!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>No ark was there—no resting-place for him!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Even Ararat was covered with the deluge.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>I understand you not.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>His wife was false.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Impossible!</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>But true. You tremble sir.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her father curst the memory of his child;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her mother withered, and soon died heart-broken.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>You seem disturbed.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>&nbsp;’Tis past. What did your son?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>He slew the slimy reptile that crawled over him;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Put his hard heel upon her glossy front,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Trampled her out in cold blood.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>God of heaven!</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>And he did right.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Your daughter!</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>He did right.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>She who betrays the honor of her husband,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Regardless of her parents, self, and children,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Should cease to live, though all unfit to die.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Better to rot in earth, than crawl through life,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Offending all things with her foul pollution.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I love my God; knowledge increases love.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I ask forgiveness of him, as Christ prayed.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I am his child, and yet I curse my child.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her sin hath made the best of prayers from my lips</p>
<p class='dramaline'>An invocation of a lasting curse</p>
<p class='dramaline'>On her old father’s head a mockery!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Forgive as I forgive—a lie to God!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Her sin hath robbed me of my prayer of childhood—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The prayer I gathered from my mother’s lips—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The prayer that opens the celestial portals—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The prayer <span class='it'>He</span> taught when <span class='it'>He</span> appeared as mortal.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>His destiny.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>He fled and took his child;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But not as Cain fled with the brand upon him.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>’Twas sacrifice to virtue, and no murder.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>When I arrived my Eden was Golgotha;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I found a corpse—my wife bereft of reason.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I buried one, attended to the other</p>
<p class='dramaline'>For years until she died. The fruits of lust!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I went to sea again in search of strife—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The quiet of the land near drove me mad.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The ship I sailed in scoured the southern sea,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>To quell the pirates. We o’ertook a rover.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A deadly strife ensued—’twas life or death;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their chief and I by chance met sword to sword;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I knew him not, and, strange, he knew not me.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>O! grief outstrips the rapid wing of time</p>
<p class='dramaline'>In marring youthful beauty! See this scar!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>His cutlas gave it—but I mastered him.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Their chief subdued, the rover soon surrendered.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>His destiny?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>The yard-arm, and a halter.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I saw him pass away.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>And said he nothing?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>Naught to the crowd—but I remember this:</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the sunset of existence,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Alone in my Gethsemane,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I quaff the cup without repining,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;For God, I feel thou’rt still with me.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Meekly obey the mandate given</p>
<p class='dramaline'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That purifies the soul for heaven.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>His cradle-hymn still chanted to the grave.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>The circle, sir—the end and the beginning—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The two ends of the chain are linked together.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>You said he had a boy.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>I said not so.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>There was a boy, whom I have searched for since;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But, like the shadows of all earthly hope,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>He hath eluded me.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>I am that boy.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>Thou!—thou that boy! The wheel is still in motion!</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>I stood beside the gallows when he died.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>His bird of Paradise! A cherub then!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I’ve seen you often sleeping among roses,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And he, a guardian angel, smiling o’er you.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>You have not slept on roses often since,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>But wept beneath your father’s gallows-tree.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And my blind deeds have shaped your destiny.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I brought your father to a shameful death,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Which your young eyes beheld. And I’ve made known</p>
<p class='dramaline'>A thing, perhaps unknown to you before—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Your mother’s infamy. Alas! poor boy!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>What an inheritance have we bequeathed you!</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>You did your duty, sir.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>Ay, there’s the question.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Can duty lead man’s footsteps to God’s throne,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Making life death, the glad earth Tartarus?</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I snatched a fellow-being, winged for heaven,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>With God’s own impress on him still unblurred,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Who, but for me, would have flown chanting there</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Anthems to angels. But with ruffian hands</p>
<p class='dramaline'>I checked his flight, and stayed him for perdition.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would that the ocean had received the child!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would I had let him perish in the flames!</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would that this wound had marked me for the grave,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ere I had saved him for an after life</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Of sin and sorrow, though impelled by—duty.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>Why do you pluck those gorgeous poppy-flowers,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>And cast them in the walk?</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>They now are harmless;</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Suffered to ripen, they are poisonous.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Let them die blooming, while they are innoxious.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Would he had perished as these simple flowers,</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Ere his bloom faded, yielding deadly seed.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Stranger.</span></span>I’ve sought you, sir, to solace your old age.</p>

<p class='speech'><span class='speaker-inline'><span class='it'>Sailor.</span></span>God bless my child! We’re in the circle still.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Good begets evil often—evil good.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The grandsire and the grandson close the chain—</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Alone—forlorn! Yet both have done their duty.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>The world goes round and round, ’till hidden things</p>
<p class='dramaline'>Stalk forth as spectres from the rotten grave.</p>
<p class='dramaline'>All, all is plain! These circles drive me mad!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>WITH FIDDLE ACCOMPANIMENT.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. CAROLINE H. BUTLER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perched, like a large gray owl with folded wings,
upon the summit of the very highest hill within a
day’s journey from “our village,” but within half a
mile of the old meeting-house, stands a narrow stone
dwelling, with a narrow, pointed roof, narrow windows,
or loop-holes, as they might be more properly
termed, and one narrow door; the whole inclosed
within a narrow yard, from which two slender poplars
point their “tall columns to the skies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One would scarcely imagine from so unpromising
an aspect that a heart-history could be gleaned from
“lifting” that narrow roof. I must confess, too, that
there is certainly very little romance in the appearance
of the inmate whom it shelters—so gaunt and
cadaverous—nearly as tall as the poplars, and with
arms like the evolving sails of a windmill. Yet, as
by searching there is gold to be found even amid the
most rocky and unpromising defiles of California, so
is there sterling mettle hid beneath the rough exterior
of Apollos Dalrymple, and this having found I will
disclose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I say that Apollos is the sole tenant of this
owl-like habitation, I need not add that he belongs
to the bachelor fraternity—but in justice to him I
will say that he was not made a bachelor from any
contempt or irreverence of the fair sex, but from
“sweet love’s teen” having “loved not wisely, but
too well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is now many years since Apollos thus retired
from the world. His hair is nearly silver white, and
old age sits upon his shoulders, yet still he washes
and mends his clothes, with his long, bony fingers
knits his stockings, and cooks his own food from the
little plat of vegetables behind the house—for Apollos
is a Grahamite, as well as a Gray-eremite. I
must retrace some twenty years in the life of Apollos,
for the first record of the heart-history I have
promised—I will even go still further back, and introduce
him a “puling infant in the nurse’s arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the misfortune of Apollos to be born with
an ear—I mean an ear for music! Whether the
euphonious name by which he was christened had
any thing to do with the quaverings of his innocent
cradle-<span class='it'>dom</span> I cannot say, but certain it is, his infantine
warblings were loud and incessant—“<span class='it'>prestissimo</span>”
and “<span class='it'>fortissimo</span>,” seldom allowing a “rest”
either to himself or his poor worn-out mother. The
period of infancy passed, Apollos was sent to school,
where he was distinguished for the long drawn
nasal tones in which he might be said to chant his
lessons, and being moreover somewhat given to
whistling and tuning up of jews-harps, the terrible
ire of Schoolmaster Ferule vented itself in drawing
long scales upon his tender flesh, to which Apollos
composed the notes upon a high key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he could read the tenth chapter of Nehemiah
without drawing a long breath, his father
made him ruler over countless heads of cattle, and
set him to ploughing and planting, sowing and reaping
the fertile acres which were one day to become
his own. Even into the drudgery of the farm Apollos
bore with him his musical mania, and while he
sowed the seed and planted the corn it was all done
to music, so that when the green grain burst through
the ground there was no stiff regularity about it, but
falling off into minims, crotchets, quavers and demi-semi-quavers,
it swept through the broad fields like
a living sheet of music, from which no doubt the
little ground-sparrow and the glassy-winged grasshopper,
learned many new variations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not “blest as the gods,” Apollos could strike no
harp but the jews-harp, for his father had no music
in his soul, though a very clever man, Shakspeare to
the contrary, and would never allow his son to spend
his earnings in cultivating so useless an art. The
singing-school he tolerated, and there, in the long
winter evenings, by the flickering light of tallow
candles did Apollos luxuriate—also at all trainings,
when “the spirit-stirring drum and ear-piercing
fife” echoed through the streets, there was the tall,
ungainly figure of Apollos to be seen, almost envying
even the little fat drummer the powers of his
<span class='it'>rub-a-dub</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day our musical hero purchased a cracked
flute! How trilled his heart in joyful cadence as he
held in his hand the precious bargain—with what
ecstasy did he turn it over and over, and then, as
soon as the cattle were foddered, and the shades of
evening resting over the farm, he would nightly retire
into the recesses of the forest, and there blow
and puff, like Sam Weller’s “aggrawated glass-blower,”
until his eyes almost started from their
sockets—the rocks and trees to be sure kept their
places in the firm earth, but the whip-po-wils and
the owls peeped forth to listen, and more than once
did he hear his notes re-echoed by some young,
aspiring screech-owl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next musical adventure of Apollos was effected
by exchanging a young and tender calf for a fiddle!
Every muscle of his long arm, became as a separate
fiddle-bow, giving forth such endless <span class='it'>see-sawing</span> and
<span class='it'>tweedle-dee-ing</span> that every good wife in the neighborhood
was tempted to complain of him as a nuisance,
for waking up all the babies and disturbing
them in their first sleep, for the strains of Apollos,
like those of “sweet Philomela,” were only
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
heard at night. But notwithstanding all this Apollos
was a general favorite, for the spirit of harmony
pervaded his bosom for all animate and inanimate
objects—there was to him music in all created
things. His heart was gentle—his hand ever ready
to do a kindness, and therefore he was suffered to
fiddle to his bent, little dreaming the anathemas
which the deed, not the doer, nightly originated.</p>

<hr class='tbk114'/>

<p class='pindent'>Side by side stood the cottages of Leonard Davis
and Luther Howell, and side by side grew up the
two lovely children Paul and Linda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Davis nor Howell were in good circumstances,
although both owned the farms on which
they lived; yet there was a great difference in the
character of the two men, which in the end led to
very different results. Leonard Davis was a thriftless,
indolent man, who loved better to smoke his
pipe under the tavern porch, and give forth his
opinions upon the politics of the day, than to cultivate
his land or keep his fences in order. Luther
Howell, on the contrary, was a hard-working, industrious
man. He loved money although he had but
little of it—yet he resolved to have more; and upon
the strength of that determination dug and delved
away his days, almost begrudging even the Sabbath
rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Linda was the youngest of his five children, all of
which, to Mr. Howell’s great chagrin were daughters.
Mr. Davis had but one child, little Paul,
whose mother had died while he was but an infant,
and Mrs. Howell feeling compassion for the motherless
boy encouraged him to play with her children,
so that by degrees the little fellow became nearly
domesticated under the same roof with the five
rosy-cheeked, happy little Howells. Paul was three
years older than Linda, and was very proud of the
confidence which Mrs. Howell reposed in his superior
age and strength, by trusting to him the care of
the little toddling girl, and repaid her confidence by
deserving it. Linda soon became more fond of Paul
than any one else, and Paul would at any time leave
his play with the older girls, or throw down his bat
and ball if he but heard the sweet voice of the little
Linda calling his name. He would lead her into
the woods, and with a natural love of the beautiful
select a spot where the moss was the greenest and
freshest, and where the golden sunlight quivering
through the dense foliage danced in playful gambols
around them—here he would carefully seat the little
girl, and gather for her the pretty wild flowers
which he found hid in the thick woods, or the bright
scarlet berries peeping out from the dark, glossy
leaves of the winter-green; and when the little
Linda was old enough to go to school, Paul still
enacted himself her champion and assistant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Linda was ten years old when Mr. Howell received
a letter from his brother, living in New York,
offering to relieve him of a share of his burdens by
adopting one of the five girls into his family. Imbued
with the same money-getting spirit as his brother,
Ansel Howell had left the village many years
previous, to seek the fortune he was resolved upon
amassing. He had been successful, and at the date
of the letter which caused so much excitement in
the humble residence of Luther, Ansel might be
considered a rich man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The offer was gladly accepted, and the question
next arose which of the girls should go forth from
the family hive. Prudence governed their decision.
Bessie could spin her day’s work with any farmer’s
daughter for miles around—Sophie was already
capable of taking charge of the dairy, while Polly
and Margaret not only could sew nearly as well as
their mother, but could also make themselves useful
in various ways about the house. Linda was of the
least service in the domestic keep, and therefore the
choice fell upon Linda, who was thus taken from
her simple country pleasures, and from her dear
friend Paul to a new home and new friends amid
the ceaseless din of a city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Luther Howell reaped the benefits of his industry.
His farm throve—his stock increased—the old house
was torn down, and a handsome, convenient two
story dwelling erected on its site; and in the course
of a few years Mr. Howell went as representative
to the state legislature, and was reckoned one of the
most substantial men in the village. But just in proportion
as things had prospered with Howell had
they gone adverse with his neighbor Davis, and
about the time when the new tenement of the former
was being raised amid the loud cheers of the
workmen, the sheriff seized upon both house and
land of the latter, and that being insufficient to meet
his debts, for “the want thereof they took the body”—at
that time imprisonment for debt was no uncommon
thing. If Davis had not been so perfectly
thriftless, in all humanity his townsmen would have
bailed him out, but the fact is, it was pretty generally
conceded that he might just as well smoke in
jail as elsewhere—pipes and tobacco therefore were
freely contributed, and in the course of a few months
poor Leonard Davis evaporated—his soul taking
flight in a whiff of tobacco smoke!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the affairs of his father became so desperate,
Paul had worked his way to New York, and
apprenticed himself in a large printing-office, trusting
with all the confidence of youth that he should
return ere many years to his native village, free his
father from the shackles of debt, and perhaps set up
an establishment of his own. Another and a brighter
vision might have mingled with these day dreams,
of which we may learn more hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul knew that his little friend Linda lived in the
same city with him, and after a long search he was
at length enabled to discover the dwelling which
sheltered the pet flower of his boyhood. But there
was such an atmosphere of grandeur around her
now, that poor Paul had not courage to penetrate
further, so for several weeks he contented himself
with hovering around the house in the evening and
on Sundays, hoping at least to obtain a glimpse of
the little girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length one day he met Linda with her governess.
It was his own Linda—yet how changed!
What a lovely young face! what grace—what innocence!
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
and then how tall! Paul forgot that years
mark their flight—he looked for the child, and he
found a beautifully formed maiden of fifteen!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, he dared not address her! he cast his eyes
upon the ground and stood still for Linda to pass!
and then as her little foot twinkled upon the pavement
close to him, and her robe brushed his coarse
garments, he involuntarily looked up. Linda turned
her large hazel eye upon him. She started—a rosy
blush mantled her sweet face! It seemed to the
maiden that she was strangely transported back to
the green grassy meadow and the play-grounds of
her infancy! Again she looked at Paul:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Linda!” he softly whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul!” responded the heart and the lips of Linda;
and with all the innocence and gladness of a
child she threw her arms around his neck, and
pressed a kiss upon his sun-burned cheek!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah that kiss—happy, happy Paul!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But here Miss Lofty interposed. It was scandalous—kissing
a young man in the street—good gracious,
who ever heard of such a thing—a fellow, too, in a
green jacket—monstrous!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, dear Miss Lofty, it is Paul—only Paul!”
cried Linda, earnestly; “how many times I have
told you about my dear, dear Paul!” and then turning
her back upon the horrified spinster, with her
little hand clasped tightly in his, she begged of him
again and again, to come and see her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you can call on Miss Howell, young man,
if you please, but you must not stand here any longer,
Miss Linda; I am really shocked at your want of
delicacy. I can hardly answer to your aunt for such
strange doings!” and so saying, Miss Lofty led off
her young charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Linda disappeared sunshine and daylight faded
from the heart of poor Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt there was now an immeasurable gulf between
him and her; and, after all, why was it that
he came to so sorrowful a conclusion? Was it because,
as Miss Lofty had said, he wore a green
jacket, and worked with his hands, while Linda sat
in her delicate robes of muslin or silk, and with
slender fingers wrought at her embroidery-frame, or
airily swept the piano. Ah, Paul, be brave! Let
not your heart fail you at mere external or worldly
distinctions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called to see Linda. It was shortly after this
first interview; she had become restrained, and her
aunt sat stately in the room, and without being rude,
yet was her manner so little removed from it, that
Paul never went again. For two or three years
Linda heard no more of the playmate and friend of
her early childhood. But Paul saw her when she
little dreamed what fond eyes were watching her!
He saw her graceful, beautiful, and accomplished;
and although he dared not whisper a hope that she
might one day be his, he resolved to improve his
mind by study and application, that he might at least
raise himself above her contempt; and so, by the
midnight lamp, the poor fellow went to work, and
for two years every leisure moment was spent in
study, and every penny he could save, employed in
procuring books for his thirsting mind. His perseverance
did not go unrewarded; his employer soon
took note of his talents, and Paul became assistant
editor of a popular weekly journal.</p>

<hr class='tbk115'/>

<p class='pindent'>By some <a id='unfo'></a>unforeseen calamity, Ansel Howell became
a poor man, and Linda returned to her father’s
roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eight years previous her parents had gladly parted
with her, and they now as gladly welcomed her back;
her sisters were all married, and the old people
quite alone, so that her presence was as the light of
morning to their lonely fireside. Her city life had
by no means spoiled Linda for the pleasures of the
country; she felt like a bird who, after being caged
a weary time, is suddenly permitted to flit at freedom
amid its native bowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Linda retained a vivid impression of the early
scenes of her childhood, and as she again revisited
each nook and dell, the remembrance of her kind
friend, Paul, also came back to her, and the present
seemed incomplete without him whose tender
care and ever ready invention to amuse her waywardness,
had cast such brightness over the days of
infancy. Where was he now? Had he forgotten
her? She thought of him as she had seen him when
he so suddenly appeared before her—those deep,
tender eyes, regarding her with so much respect and
affection; and then, when admitted into the stately
dwelling of her uncle, he had come forward so modestly,
yet with so much self-respect to greet her,
and her heart reproached her, that, through fear of
her aunt’s displeasure, she had, perhaps, treated him
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, dear Paul, I am sure I did not mean to be
unkind!” she mentally exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, if Paul, as he sat in his office in that narrow,
confined street, bending so diligently over his desk,
in the sultry breath of the city, could have known
the thoughts of the fair girl, as she strolled through
the summer woods, what rapture would have thrilled
his bosom, and how would the dull atmosphere in
which he toiled have become irradiate in the light of
love and happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Has the reader forgotten Apollos—the Apollo—the
Paganini, whose witched fiddle-bow made both
echoes and babies shriek in concert?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It chanced one evening that Apollos, out of resin,
set forth for the village to supply that dire necessity.
Whistling he went, when suddenly there were borne
to his ear strains of most ravishing sweetness, now
softly swelling on the evening breeze—now fainter
and fainter dying away until even silence seemed
musical, and then again bursting forth so free and
joyous, that the very air around him vibrated with
melody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Spell bound stood Apollos. The doors of his great
ears swung back to welcome in the harmony, and
his mouth, too, opened as if to swallow it. Then,
led on as it were by invisible spirits, his feet followed
the bewitching sounds, and planted themselves
under the large button-ball tree which stood
near the window where Linda was thus unconsciously
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
drawing both soul and body of Apollos magnetically
unto her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Conceive his perfect rapture as thus, so near the
centre of attraction, the sweet strains encompassed
him about. They ceased, and then to the window,
still warbling, the young girl came, and leaning
from the casement, stretched forth her little white
hand, and began plucking the leaves from the very
tree whose shadowing branches waved around the
head of Apollos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sweet face becomes almost as the face of an
angel, when seen in the calm moonlight; and as
Linda stood there, her large, brown eyes, looking out
into the holy night, her high, pure forehead clasped
in the glossy braids of her dark hair, and her light,
graceful figure folded in a snowy robe, no wonder
she seemed to Apollos too pure, too beautiful, for a
being of earth’s mould. But while he gazed and
gazed, she turned away, and with her took the heart
of Apollos. Again seating herself at the piano, Linda
ran her fingers over the keys with the lightness of a
bird upon the wing, and one of Beethoven’s exquisite
sonatas awoke to life under her touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Apollos! No volition had he of his own—he
went whither the fates impelled him. Step by step
did he approach the open casement, and as some
poor bird is drawn, little by little, into the very
mouth of its fascinating destroyer, even so was
Apollos drawn head and shoulders into the window.
The moon beams danced around him, as if enjoying
the mischief they were about to disclose, and gleamed
coldly but steadily upon him, his elbows resting on
the sill, and his long legs, curved outward, like those
of a grasshopper. At last, rising from the instrument,
Linda closed it, and was about to approach
the window, when the strange apparition of Apollos
glared upon her. With a loud shriek she rushed
from the room; as for Apollos, he bounded away
like a madman—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Swift on the right—swift on the left,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Sweeps every scene asunder—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;Heaths, meadows, fields—how swift their flight,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And now the bridges thunder!”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That night Apollos Dalrymple was convicted of
having seen a ghost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, from that eventful evening, Cupid ensconced
himself within the virgin heart of Apollos,
and there the little rascal sat perched upon a hill of
ancient ballads, delighted with the mischief he was
doing, and every now and then beating up such a
rub-a-dub as well-nigh drove poor Apollos distracted.
For here were garnered up stores of the dainty food
which the poets have appropriated exclusively to
the little god—not, to be sure, the fastidious fare of a
modern amateur, supping only on the tongues of
Italian or Swedish nightingales, but the good, substantial
fare our forefathers loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the death of his father all those goodly acres
had descended to Apollos; but this year the farm
proved a losing concern, for the sheep died from
starvation—the cattle from over-feeding—the hoe
cut down both corn and weed—the grass luxuriated
in freedom from the scythe, and the grain from the
sickle, until both were over-ripe. The people all
thought Apollos bewitched, and bewitched he certainly
was. Even the fiddle was suffered to be
mute, unless when seizing it with sudden furor he
would strive to repeat some note which the voice of
Linda had fastened upon his memory, but as sure as
he did so, her image appeared at his working elbow,
and Cupid, with a jog, jumped astride the fiddle-bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a beautiful simplicity in the heart of
Apollos—an almost maidenly delicacy. He shrunk
from intruding upon the fair object of his thoughts,
never once did he speak with her, or seek to claim
her acquaintance. She was to him something too
divine to approach, and he worshiped her at a distance—a
star whose beams blended with the music
of his soul. There was no vanity hid away in his
brain; he saw himself as others saw him—a rough,
ungainly figure, without comeliness or proportion,
and the more did he strive to cultivate those inward
graces by which even his ugliness was made to be
forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How little did Linda dream, as she sometimes
passed him in her walks, what a great heart throbbed
for her, and would have poured out its life-blood
in her service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The summer following Paul Davis revisited his
birth-place, and for the first time for many years he
and Linda met again. In form and feature both
were changed—but in both the heart remained the
same, and the same affinity which had in childhood
bound them, now by a closer and dearer tie united
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Howell’s other four daughters had all
married rich men; and as Linda was the fairest and
most accomplished, he had planned for her a match
which might be considered brilliant. When, therefore,
Paul asked for her hand, it was refused with
the contempt of one who feels that riches, not affection
and kindness make up the <span class='it'>summum bonum</span> of
life’s happiness, and with whom the weight of the
purse out-balances the weight of both head and heart.
And then Pride, too, put in her voice—<span class='it'>what</span>, his
daughter marry the son of Leonard Davis, who died
in a jail! To be sure, he understood that Paul was
doing a very good business in the editorial line; but
then a mere editor—a drudge for the public—<span class='it'>bah</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so Paul was scornfully dismissed, and returned
to the city, yet bearing with him the sworn faith
of her he loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smiles faded from the cheek of Linda, and her
voice now seldom sent its glad notes to cheer the
heart of Apollos. He saw she was pale, and that
her step was listless. He felt she was unhappy, and
now, in addition to his own grief, he bore about with
him the pain of knowing that she, too, had sorrows
which he could not heal. He would have had her
so happy. Around her path only thornless roses
should have clustered, and how gladly would he
have shielded her from all the storms of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, poor Apollos! if it could have been; if, like
the great branches of the oak which shelter the
timid daisy from sun and rain, those great arms of
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
thine would have enfolded this little flower—then,
indeed, would thy big soul have leaped with gladness.</p>

<hr class='tbk116'/>

<p class='pindent'>Months passed on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul worked at his desk patiently, and hoping that
by some favor of fortune he might yet claim the
hand of Linda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time the proprietor of the establishment
in which he was employed, desirous of making
a change in his business, offered to sell out at a price
very advantageous for the purchaser. Paul would
gladly have availed himself of this opportunity, but
his means were insufficient, and he knew of no
person of whom he could solicit the required sum.
While the sale was pending Paul again visited the
village, not with any idea of a second time subjecting
himself to the rudeness of Mr. Howell by a further
request for the hand of his daughter. He went,
therefore, as on ardent lover may be supposed to go,
impelled by a desire of seeing again the object of his
affection, and of hearing from her dear lips a renewed
assurance of her truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it chanced that the very afternoon of his
arrival, Apollos strolled forth in somewhat melancholy
mood, and took a path leading through a thick
grove bordering upon his farm. It was one of those
cold, gloomy days in March, when not a bud or a
leaf has as yet betokened the grateful advent of
spring. Little patches of ice and snow still clung
around the decaying leaves, frozen into black heaps
where the autumn winds had gathered in their many
dead; the wind rattled the naked branches of the
trees in the dull, chill atmosphere; flights of crows
flew low with their dismal croak, and the squirrel
now and then looked out timidly from the old brown
trunks, as if to note the aspect of the weather, and
feeling the biting wind upon his nose, turned nimbly
back to his hole again. It was through these gloomy
woods, therefore, that Apollos bent his way, and had
nearly cleared the grove, when his reveries were
suddenly interrupted by hearing the sound of voices
from a thick cluster of young pines, whose green,
spiral branches gave relief to the brown aspect of
the surrounding trees. He recognized at once the
accents of Linda; there was sadness in them, and
he involuntarily paused, not with any intention of
becoming a listener from curiosity, but only to drink
in her beloved tones. His next impulse was to retreat
softly; but the words which her companion
spoke arrested his attention anew, and so he stood
irresolute, anxious to learn more, and yet unwilling
to steal thus into the secrets of the young pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dearest Linda, we must be patient and
hopeful,” said Paul. “The assurance of your love
will inspire me with fresh ardor in this struggle with
fortune, and in the end, Linda, I am sure to come off
conqueror. I wish not to reproach your father, but
I flattered myself that wealth would not have been
so great a consideration with him, and that as he
has known me from my childhood, he would have
preferred an honest, truthful heart, and the happiness
of his child to the glitter of gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hoped so, too, dear Paul; perhaps he will yet
alter his determination; let us hope for the best,”
answered Linda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A few thousand dollars would at this moment
place me in a situation to demand your hand a
second time, dear Linda,” continued Paul. “Mr.
Neeland wishes to dispose of his establishment, and
offers it at so reasonable an estimate that I would
gladly become a purchaser if I had but the means—this,
Linda, would remove the scruples of your
father, and crown our happiness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, dear Paul. Ah! would that some kind
friend might assist you. You have friends, I am
sure—are there none of whom you can ask this
favor?” said Linda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—it is a kindness I do not feel authorised to
ask from any one—it would involve me at once in
obligations which I might not be able to fulfill—no,
dearest Linda, I must toil on a few more years, and
if my labors are followed with the same success
which has heretofore crowned them, I shall have
earned, even in your father’s estimation, the rich
reward I would fain this moment call my own,”
replied Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loving Linda as he did so faithfully, it was impossible
that Apollos could listen to this conversation
without a struggle between envy and the natural
kindness of his heart. It is true, he knew before
that his love was hopeless—that the young and fair
object of his adoration could be no more to him than
the distant planet shining so gloriously in the glittering
dome of the heavens—but here stood one possessing
that priceless gift, her heart, one on whom
her first pure affections were <a id='best'></a>bestowed—ah, poor
Apollos—it was not in human nature to resist the
workings of jealousy and envy—great drops of
anguish stood on his pale brow, and he almost
groaned aloud! Then better and nobler feelings
stirred his bosom—he gave way to their healthful
promptings, and a load seemed lifted from his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul parted with Linda at her father’s gate and
went home to his lodgings, where he had not been
long seated, when an ill-written, almost illegible
note was handed him. It was from Apollos Dalrymple,
requesting earnestly to see him before he
should leave the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some old debt, doubtless, of my poor father’s,
which I am required to pay,” thought Paul. “Well,
I will go and see him, and if in my power it shall
be canceled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he drew near the dwelling of Apollos, the
strains of the fiddle seemed to welcome him on, and
knocking at the door it was opened by the owner
himself—his great chin holding firm to his breast the
neck of the instrument, and his hand wielding the
bow. Walking before him into a small back room,
he made signs for him to be seated, and then taking
up the air where the summons of Paul had interrupted
it, he played it deliberately through!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul thought this proceeding very rude, to say the
least of it—but if he could have read the heart of
Apollos, he would have seen that he was only striving
to lull into peace by the soothing powers of
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
melody those rebellious and evil passions which the
sight of his happier rival called forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, carefully hanging up the fiddle on a peg
at his right hand, Apollos opened a small drawer,
and taking out a pocket-book, put it into the hand
of his astonished visiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon there is just two thousand dollars there—it
is yours,” he said, bluntly. “I guess you’ll
make a pretty straight bargain with that man that
wants to sell out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul sat speechless with surprise at finding his
affairs thus known to the strange man before him.
Apollos arose, went to the window, and began to
whistle, then added in a husky voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon old Howell wont object any longer; so
you can—can marry—Linda!” and with another
vociferous whistle, he again sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time Paul, somewhat recovered from his
first amazement, said, as he handed back the pocket-book,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear sir, I cannot accept of your bounty
I may never be able to repay you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put up the money, I say, put it up—it is yours,”
interrupted Apollos; “I—I—overheard your talk
with Linda, this afternoon—so you see I know all
about you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why this interest for a stranger, Mr. Dalrymple—how
can I ever repay—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be kind to her—to Linda—that’s all the pay I
want!” hastily interposed Apollos. “And you see,
Paul, if you want any further help to get along, I
conclude you are bound to come to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Paul attempted to be heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least suffer me to explain my affairs to you,
that you may know better the man upon whom your
kindness has so liberally fallen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon I know you; you’re an honest, good
lad—and—and Linda loves you—you need not say a
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, indeed, had Paul been gifted with the eloquence
of an Adams or a Webster, Apollos would
not have listened to him, for no sooner did he see the
money safe in the pocket of the young man, than he
coolly arose, put on his hat, and taking his violin,
walked out of the house; so Paul had no alternative
than to do the same, yet leaving upon the table an
acknowledgment of his gratitude, written with a
pencil on the back of an old letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next week three topics of interest were going
the rounds of the village, and arousing the curiosity
and wonder of its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first was, that the son of Leonard Davis had
become the sole proprietor of one of the largest printing
offices in the city of New York—who would have
thought it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second item was, that Apollos Dalrymple had
offered his fine farm for sale—what could it mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third and most wonderful was, that the said
Apollos commenced building the identical narrow
stone-house on the top of the hill—was the man bewitched,
or going to be married!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the summer Paul again solicited
the hand of Linda, which was no longer refused
him—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“For money has a power above</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;The stars, and fate, to manage love.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But Apollos refused to be present at the happy
event which his noble kindness had so materially
assisted to bring about; and little did either of them
surmise the generous devotion which had called it
forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as his solitary dwelling was completed,
Apollos, taking with him a few goods and chattels,
removed thereto. And there he still abides with
peace in his heart, and “good-will to all men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He admits no visiters—yet is his bounty never the
less; for, like some forest rill, which has its source
hidden among the rocks, yet whose presence revivifies
and fertilizes all around it, so do the streams
of his bounty, flowing silently and unobtrusively,
gladden and refresh the hearts of the weary and destitute.
He never goes out, except on the Sabbath,
upon whose sacred services he is a constant attendant,
and may always be seen in his suit of homespun
gray, standing erect near the choir, and beating
time with his long, bony hand, to the music of the
psalms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the calm summer evenings, the notes of his
violin are borne on the gentle breeze to the ears of
the villagers, and as the plough-boy hies him to his
task, with the early up-rising of the lark, he hears
the morning hymn of the forest choristers, accompanied
in their notes of praise by the music of
<span class='it'>Apollos’ violin</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The death of this eminent poet, after an honorable
and useful life, prolonged to eighty years, will doubtless
provoke a new conflict of opinions regarding the
nature and influence of his great and peculiar mind.
The universal feeling among all lovers of what is
deep, and delicate, and genuine in poetry, must be—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“That there has passed away a glory from the earth;”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and not until literature receives an original impulse
from a nature equally profound and powerful, will it
be called upon to mourn such a departure “from
the sunshine into the Silent Land.” His death was
worthy of an earthly career consecrated by devout
and beautiful meditations to a life beyond life—his
soul, so long the serene guest of his mortal frame,
meekly withdrawing itself at the end to a world not
unfamiliar to his raised vision here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We confess, at the outset, to an admiration for
Wordsworth’s genius bordering on veneration, but
we trust that we can speak of it without substituting
hyperbole for analysis, without burying the essential
facts of his mental constitution under a load of panegyric.
It appears to us that these facts alone convict
his depreciating critics of malice or ignorance;
that the kind of criticism to which he was originally
subjected, and which even now occasionally
reappears with something of the sting of its
old flippancy, is essentially superficial and untenable,
failing to cover the ground it pretends to occupy, and
disguising nonsense under a garb of shrewdness and
discrimination. The opinion of a man of ability on
subjects which he understands, and on objects he
really discerns, is entitled to respect, and we do not
deny that Jeffrey’s opinions on many important
matters are sound and valuable; but, in relation to
Wordsworth, whom he perversely misunderstood,
he appears presumptuously incompetent and undiscerning
throughout his much vaunted criticisms;
in every case missing the peculiarities which constituted
Wordsworth’s originality, and satirizing
himself in almost every sarcasm he launched at the
poet. The usual defense set up for such a critic is,
that he judges by the rules of common sense; but
every poet who deserves the name is to be judged
by the common sense of the creative imagination,
not by the common sense of the practical understanding;
and thus judged, thus removed from the
jurisdiction of the mere police of letters, we imagine
that Wordsworth will readily assume his place as
the greatest of English poets since Milton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In claiming for him a position in that line of English
poets which contains no other names than those
of Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare, and Milton, we
imply that he is not only great as an individual
writer, but that he is the head and founder of a new
school of poets; that he is the point from which the
future historian of English letters will consider the
poetry of the age; that he introduced into English
literature new elements, whose inspiration has not
yet spent itself, but continues to influence almost
every poet of the day; that</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Thither, as to their fountain, other stars</p>
<p class='line0'>Repairing, in their golden urns draw light.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This fact can be chronologically proved. In the
“Lines on Revisiting <a id='tint'></a>Tintern Abbey,” written as
far back as 1798, and in which we have the key-note
of Wordsworth’s whole system of viewing nature
and man, we perceive not only a new element
of thought added to English poetry, but an element
which appears afterward in Shelley and Byron—modified,
of course, by their individuality—and still appears,
with decreasing force, in Tennyson and
Browning. Plato and Lord Bacon are not more decidedly
originators of new scientific methods than
Wordsworth is the originator of a new poetical
method. Even if we dislike him, and neglect his
poetry, we cannot emancipate ourselves from his
influence, as long as we are thrilled by the most
magnificent and etherial passages in Shelley and
Byron. We may be offended at the man, but we
cannot escape from his method, unless our reading
of the poets stops with Goldsmith and Cowper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vital poems of Wordsworth—those which
are really inspired with his spirit and life, and not
mere accretions attached to his works—form a complete
whole, pervaded by one living soul, and, amid
all their variety of subject, related to one leading
idea—the marriage of the soul of man to the external
universe, whose “spousal hymn” the poet chants.
They constitute together the spiritual body of his
mind, exhibiting it as it grew into beautiful and melodious
form through thirty years of intense contemplation.
To a person who has studied his works
with sufficient care to obtain a conception of the
author’s personality, every little lyric is alive with
his spirit, and is organically connected with the long
narrative and didactive poems. This body of verse
is, we think, a new creation in literature, differing
from others not only in degree but in kind—an organism,
having its own interior laws, growing from
one central principle, and differing from Spenser and
Milton as a swan does from an eagle, or a rose from
a lily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We need hardly say that the central power and
principle of this organic body of verse is Wordsworth
himself. He is at its heart and circumference,
and through all its veins and arteries, as the vivifying
and organizing force—coloring every thing with his
peculiar individuality, representing man and nature
through the medium of his own original and originating
genius, and creating, as it were, a new world
of forms and beings, idealized from hints given by
the actual appearances of things. This world is
not so various as that of Shakspeare or Scott, nor
so supernatural as that of Milton, but it is still Wordsworth’s
world, a world conceived by himself, and
in which he lived and moved and had his being. A
true criticism of his works, therefore, would be a
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
biography of his mind, exhibiting the vital processes
of its growth, and indicating the necessary connection
between its gradual interior development and
the imaginative forms in which it was expressed.
This we cannot pretend to do, having neither the
insight nor the materials for such a task, and we shall
be content with attempting a faint outline of his
mental character, with especial reference to those
qualities which dwelt near the heart of his being,
and which seem to have been woven into the texture
of his mind at birth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wordsworth was born in April, 1770, of parents
sufficiently rich to give him the advantages of the
usual school and collegiate education of English
youth. He early manifested a love for study, but it
may be inferred that his studies were such as mostly
ministered to the imagination, from the fact that he
displayed, from his earliest years, a passion for
poetry, and never seems to have had a thought of
choosing a profession. At the university of Cambridge
he appears to have studied the classics with
the divining eye and assimilating mind of a poet, and
if he did not attain the first position as a classical
scholar, he certainly drank in beyond all his fellows
the spirit of the great writers of Greece and Rome.
In a mind so observing, studious, thoughtful, imaginative
and steadfast as his, whose power consisted
more in concentration of view than rapidity
of movement, the images of classical poetry must
have been firmly held and lovingly contemplated;
and to his collegiate culture we doubtless owe the
exquisite poems of Dion and Laodamia, the grand
interpretative, uplifting mythological passage in The
Excursion, and the general felicity of his classical
allusions and images throughout his works. He
probably wrote much as well as meditated deeply
at college, but very few of his juvenile pieces have
been preserved, and those which are seem little
more than exercises in expression. On leaving college
he appears to have formed the determination of
educating his poetical faculty by a communion with
the forms of nature, as others study law and theology.
He resided for some time in the west of England,
and at about the age of twenty, made the tour of
France, Italy, Switzerland and Germany, traveling,
like our friend Bayard Taylor, mostly on foot, diving
into forests, lingering by lakes, penetrating into the
cottages of Italian peasants and rude German boors,
and alternating the whole by a residence in the great
European cities. This seems to have occupied
nearly two years of his life; its immediate, but not its
only result, was the publication of his “Descriptive
Sketches in Verse,” indicating accurate observation
rather than shaping imagination, and undistinguished
by any marked peculiarities of thought or diction.
We next hear of him at Bristol, the companion
of Coleridge and Southey, and discussing
with those eager and daring spirits the essential
falsehood of current poetry as a representation of
nature. The sensible conclusion of all three was
this—that the worn-out epithets and images then in
vogue among the rhymers, were meaningless; that
poetry was to be sought in nature and man; and that
the language of poetry was not a tinsel rhetoric, but
an impassioned utterance of thoughts and emotions
awakened by a direct contact of the mind with the
objects it described. Of these propositions, the last
was one of primary importance, and in a mind so
grave, deep and contemplative as Wordsworth’s,
with an instinctive ambition to be one of “Nature’s
Privy Council,” and dive into the secrets of those
visible forms which had ever thrilled his soul with
a vague and aching rapture, the mere critical opinion
passed into a motive and an inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lyrical Ballads,” published in 1798, and
to which Southey and Coleridge contributed, were
the first poems which indicated Wordsworth’s peculiar
powers and passions, and gave the first hints
of his poetical philosophy, and the first startling
shock to the tastes of the day. They were mostly
written at Allfoxden, near the Bristol Channel, in
one of the deepest solitudes in England, amid woods,
glens, streams, and hills. Here Wordsworth had
retired with his sister; and Coleridge was only five
miles distant at Stowey. Cottle relates some amusing
anecdotes of the ignorance of the country people, in
regard to them, and to poets and lovers of the picturesque
generally. Southey, Coleridge and his wife,
Lamb, and the two Wedgewoods, visited Wordsworth
in his retirement, and the whole company
used to wander about the woods, and by the sea, to
the great wonder of all the honest people they met.
As they were often out at night, it was supposed
they led a dissolute life; and it is said that there are
respectable people in Bristol who believe now that
Mrs. Coleridge and Miss Wordsworth were disreputable
women, from a remembrance of the scandalous
tattle circulating then. Cottle asserts that
Wordsworth was driven from the place by the suspicions
which his habits provoked, being refused a
continuance of his lease of the Allfoxden house by
the ignoramus who had the letting of it, on the ground
that he was a criminal in the disguise of an idler.
One of the villagers said, “that he had seen him
wander about at night <span class='it'>and look rather strangely at
the moon</span>! And then he roamed over the hills like
a partridge.” Another testified “he had heard him
mutter, as he walked, in some outlandish brogue,
that nobody could understand.” This last, we suppose,
is the rustic version of the poet’s own statement—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“He murmurs near the running brooks</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;A music sweeter than their own.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Others, however, took a different view of his habits,
as little flattering to his morals as the other view to
his sense. One wiseacre remarked confidently, “I
know what he is. We have all met him tramping
away toward the sea. Would any man in his senses
take all that trouble to look at a parcel of water? I
think he carries on a snug business in the smuggling
line, and, in these journeys, is on the lookout for
some <span class='it'>wet</span> cargo.” Another, carrying out this bright
idea, added, “I know he has got a private still in his
cellar; for I once passed his house at a little better
than a hundred yards distance, and I could smell
the spirits as plain as an ashen faggot at Christmas.”
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
But the charge which probably had the most weight
in those times was the last. “I know,” said one,
“that he is surely a desperd French Jacobin; for he
is so silent and dark that no one ever heard him say
one word about politics.” The result of all these
various rumors and scandals was the removal of
Wordsworth from the village. It is curious that,
with such an experience of English country-people,
Wordsworth should never have looked at them
dramatically, and represented them as vulgar and
prejudiced human beings as well as immortal souls.
It proves that humor did not enter at all into the
constitution of his nature; that man interested him
more than men; and that his spiritual affections, connecting
humanity constantly with its divine origin,
shed over the simplest villager a light and atmosphere
not of earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the ludicrous tattle to which we have referred
was sounding all around him, he was meditating
Peter Bell and the Lyrical Ballads, in the
depths of the Allfoxden woods, and consecrating the
rustics who were scandalizing him. The great Poet
of the Poor, who has made the peasant a grander
object of contemplation than the peer, and who saw
through vulgar externals and humble occupations to
the inmost soul of the man, had sufficient provocations
to be the satirist of those he idealized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these Lyrical Ballads, and in the poems written
at the same period of their publication, we perceive
both the greatness and the limitations of Wordsworth,
the vital and the mechanical elements in his poetry.
As far as his theory of poetic diction was unimaginative,
as far as its application was willful, it became
a mere matter of the understanding, productive
of little else than shocks to taste and the poetic
sense, and indicating the perversity of a powerful
intellect, pushing preconceived theories to the violation
of ideal laws, rather than the rapt inspiration
of the bard, flooding common words and objects with
new life and divine meanings. It is useless to say
that the passages to which we object would not provoke
a smile if read in the spirit of the author.
They are ludicrous in themselves, and would have
made the author himself laugh had he possessed a
moderate sense of the humorous. But the gravest
objection against them is, that they do not harmonize
with the poems in which they appear—are not
vitally connected with them, but stand as excrescences
plastered <span class='it'>on</span> them—and instantly suggest the
theorizer expressing his scorn of an opposite vice of
expression, by deliberately substituting for affected
elegance a simplicity just as full of affectation.
Wordsworth’s true simplicity, the simplicity which
was the natural vehicle of his grand and solemn
thoughts, the simplicity which came from writing
close to the truth of things, and making the word
rise out of the idea conceived like Venus from the
sea, cannot be too much commended; but in respect
to his false simplicity, his simplicity for the sake of
being simple, we can only say that it has given some
point to the sarcasm, “that Chaucer writes like a
child, but Wordsworth childishly.” These objectionable
passages, however, are very few; they
stand apart from his works and apart from what was
essential in him; and they are to be pardoned, as
we pardon the occasional caprices of other great
poets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another objection to the Lyrical Ballads, and to
Wordsworth’s poems generally, is an objection
which relates to his noblest creations. He never
appears to have thoroughly realized that other men
were not Wordsworths, and accordingly he not infrequently
violates the law of expression—which we
take to be the expression of a man to others, not the
expression of a man to himself. He speaks, as it
were, too much to his own ear, and having associated
certain words with subtle thoughts and moods peculiar
to himself, he does not seem aware that the
words may not of themselves convey his meaning
to minds differently constituted, and accustomed to
take the expressions at their lexicon value. In this
he differs from Coleridge, whose words and music
have more instantaneous power in evoking the mood
addressed, and thread with more force and certainty
all the mental labyrinths of other minds, and act
with a tingling and inevitable touch on the finest
nerves of spiritual perception. The Ancient Mariner
and Christobel almost create the moods in which
they are to be read, and surprise the reader with a
revelation of the strange and preternatural elements
lying far back in his own consciousness. Wordsworth
has much of this wondrous wizard power, but
it operates with less direct energy, and is not felt in
all its witchery until we have thought into his
mind, become enveloped in its atmosphere, and been
initiated into the “suggestive sorcery” of his language.
Then, it appears to us, he is even more
satisfying than Coleridge, moving, as he does, in the
transcendental region of thought with a calmer and
more assured step, and giving evidence of having
steadily gazed on those spiritual realities which
Coleridge seems to have casually seen by flashes of
lightning. His language consequently is more temperate,
as befits a man observing objects familiar to
his mind by frequent contemplation; but, to common
readers, it would be more effective if it had the suddenness
and startling energy coming from the first
bright vision of supernatural objects. As it is, however,
his style proves that his mind had grown up to
those heights of contemplation to which the mind of
Coleridge only occasionally darted, under the winged
impulses of imagination; and therefore Wordsworth
gives more serene and permanent delight, more
“sober certainty of waking bliss,” than Coleridge,
however much the latter may excel in instantaneousness
of effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The originality of the Lyrical Ballads consisted
not so much in an accurate observation of nature as
in an absolute communion with her, and interpretation
of the spirit of her forms. They combine in a
remarkable degree ecstasy with reflection, and are
marvelously refined both in their perception of the life
of nature and the subtle workings of human affections.
Those elusive emotions which flit dimly before ordinary
imaginations and then instantly disappear,
Wordsworth arrests and embodies; and the remotest
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
shades of feeling and thought, which play on the
vanishing edges of conception, he connects with familiar
objects, and brings home to our common contemplations.
In the sphere of the affections he is
confessedly great. The still, simple, searching pathos
of “We are Seven,” the mysterious, tragic interest
gathered around “The Thorn,” and the evanescent
touch of an elusive mood in “The Anecdote for
Fathers,” indicate a vision into the finest elements
of emotion. The poems entitled, “Expostulation
and Reply,” “The Tables Turned,” “Lines Written
in Early Spring,” “To My Sister,” and several
others, referring to this period of 1798, evince many
of the peculiar qualities of his philosophy, and combine
depth of insight with a most exquisite simplicity
of phrase. The following extracts contain hints of
his whole system of thought, expressing that belief
in the life of nature, and the mode by which that life
is communicated to the mind, which reappear,
variously modified, throughout his writings:</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most remarkable poem written at this
period of Wordsworth’s life, is that on Tintern
Abbey, “Lines Composed on Revisiting the Banks
of the Wye.” We have here that spiritualization of
nature, that mysterious sense of the Being pervading
the whole universe of matter and mind, that feeling
of the vital connection between all the various forms
and kinds of creation, and that marriage of the soul
of man with the visible universe, which constitute
the depth and the charm of Wordsworth’s “divine
philosophy.” After describing the landscape which
he now revisits, he proceeds to develop the influence
it has exerted on his spirit:</p>

<p class='line0'>As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye:</p>
<p class='line0'>But oft in lonely rooms, and ’mid the din</p>
<p class='line0'>Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,</p>
<p class='line0'>In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'>And passing even into my purer mind</p>
<p class='line0'>With tranquil restoration; feelings, too,</p>

<p class='line0'>On that best portion of a good man’s life,</p>
<p class='line0'>His little nameless, unremembered acts</p>

<p class='line0'>To them I may have owed another gift</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then proceeds to describe the passionate fascination
which nature exerted over his youth, and the
change which had come over him by a deeper and
more thoughtful communion with her spirit. When
we consider that Wordsworth, at this time, was
only twenty-eight, and that even the motions described
in the first part of our extract had no existence
in contemporary poetry, we can form some idea
of his giant leap in advance of his age, as indicated
by the unspeakable beauty and novelty of the concluding
portion. Our readers will notice that although
the style becomes almost transfigured by the intense
and brooding imagination which permeates it, the
diction is still as simple as prose:</p>

<p class='line0'>What then I was. The sounding cataract</p>
<p class='line0'>Haunted me like a passion; the tall rock,</p>
<p class='line0'>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</p>
<p class='line0'>Their colors and their forms, were then to me</p>
<p class='line0'>An appetite, a feeling, and a love,</p>
<p class='line0'>That had no need of a remoter charm,</p>
<p class='line0'>By thought supplied, nor any interest</p>
<p class='line0'>Unborrowed from the eye. That time is past,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all its aching joys are now no more,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this</p>
<p class='line0'>Faint I, nor mourn, nor murmur; other gifts</p>

<p class='line0'>The still, sad music of humanity,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power</p>

<p class='line0'>A presence that disturbs me with the joy</p>

<p class='pindent'>This poem enables us to understand the process
by which so peculiar a nature as Wordsworth’s
grew up into its spiritual stature. It was by placing
his mind in direct contact with natural objects,
passively receiving their impressions in the still
hours of contemplation, and bringing his own soul
into such sweet relations to the soul of nature as to
“see into the life of things;” or, as he expresses it,
in another connection, “his soul had <span class='it'>sight</span>” of those
spiritual realities, of which visible forms and hues are
but the embodiment and symbolical language. Nature
to him was therefore always <span class='it'>alive</span>, spiritually
as well as visibly <span class='it'>existing</span>; and he felt the correspondence
between his own life and her life, from
perceiving that one spirit penetrated both. Not only
did he perceive this, but he mastered the secret
alphabet by which man converses with nature, and
to his soul she spoke an audible language. Indeed,
his mind’s ear was even more acute than his mind’s
eye; and no poet has excelled him in the subtle
perception of the most remote relations of tone.
Often, when he is on the peaks of spiritual contemplation,
he hears voices when he cannot see shapes,
and mutters mystically of his whereabouts in words
which suggest rather than embody meaning. He
grew in spiritual strength and height by assimilating
the life of nature, as bodies grow by assimilating
her grosser elements; and this process was little disturbed
by communion with other minds, either
through books or society. He took nothing at second-hand;
and his nature is therefore not the nature of
Homer, or Dante, or Shakspeare, or Milton, or Scott,
but essentially the nature of Wordsworth, the nature
which he saw with his own eyes, and shaped with
his own imagination. His humanity sprung from
this insight, for not until he became impressed with
the spirit of nature, and divined its perfect adaptation
to nourish and elevate the human mind, did he perceive
the worth and dignity of man. Then simple
humanity assumed in his mind a mysterious grandeur,
and humble life was spiritualized by his consecrating
and affectionate imagination. He might
then say, with something of a proud content,</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall give but one more extract; illustrative

<p class='line0'>Is littleness; that he who feels contempt</p>
<p class='line0'>For any living thing, hath faculties</p>
<p class='line0'>Which he has never used; that thought with him</p>
<p class='line0'>Is in its infancy. The man whose eye</p>

<p class='line0'>The least of Nature’s works, one who might move</p>

<p class='line0'>True dignity abides with him alone</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have dwelt thus long on Wordsworth’s first
characteristic publication, because it expresses so
well the nature of his own mind, and because it
gave an original impulse to poetical literature. These
Lyrical Ballads were published in the summer of
1798, and though they attracted no general attention
corresponding to their original merit, they exercised
great influence upon all the young minds who were
afterward to influence the age. In September, 1798,
in company with Coleridge, he visited Germany,
and on his return he settled at Grasmere, in Westmoreland;
a spot so well known to all readers of his
poetry, and where he continued to reside for fifteen
years. In 1803 he married a Miss Mary Hutchinson,
of Penrith. Neither was wealthy, their joint
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
income being but £100 a year. Of his wife we
know little, except that she was of small stature and
gentle manners, and was loved by her husband with
that still, deep devotion characteristic of his affections.
He refers to her, in a poem written in his old
age, as</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>She who dwells with me, whom I have loved</p>
<p class='line0'>With such communion, that no place on earth</p>
<p class='line0'>Can ever be a solitude to me.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Between 1803 and 1807, when a second volume
of Lyrical Ballads was published, he wrote many of
the most beautiful and sublime poems in his whole
works. To this period belong “The Memorials of
a Tour in Scotland,” (1803,) containing “The Solitary
Reaper,” “The Highland Girl,” “Ellen Irwin,”
“Rob Roy’s Grave,” and other exquisite and glowing
impersonations—his grand sonnets dedicated to
“National Independence and Liberty”—“The Horn
of Egremont Castle,” “Heart-Leap Well,” “Character
of a Happy Warrior,” “A Poet’s Epitaph,”
“Vandracour and Julia,” the “Ode to Duty,” and,
above all, the sublime “Ode on the Intimations of
Immortality from the Recollections of Childhood,”
which appears not to have been struck off at one
beat, but to have been composed at various periods
between the years 1803 and 1806.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are no events, in the common acceptation
of the term, in Wordsworth’s life after the period of
his marriage, except the publication of his various
works, and the pertinacious war waged against them
by the influential critics. Though his means were
at first limited, he soon, through the friendship of
the Earl of Lonsdale, received the appointment of
Distributor of Stamps for the counties of Westmoreland
and Cumberland, a sinecure office, the duties
of which were done by clerks, but which seems to
have given him an income sufficient for his wants.
In 1809 he published a prose work on the “Convention
of Cintra,” which, though designed as a popular
appeal in favor of the oppressed Spaniards, was little
read at the time, and is now forgotten. Southey,
whose mind was on fire with sympathy for the
Spanish cause, says of this pamphlet, in a letter to
Scott—“Wordsworth’s pamphlet will fail of producing
any general effect, because the sentences are
long and involved; and his friend, De Quincey, who
corrected the press, has rendered them more obscure
by an unsound system of punctuation. This fault
will outweigh all its merits. The public never can
like any thing which they feel it difficult to understand.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I impute Wordsworth’s want of perspicuity
to two causes—his admiration of Milton’s
prose, and his habit of dictating instead of writing:
if he were his own scribe his eye would tell him
where to stop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the great work to which Wordsworth was
devoting the best years of his life, was his long philosophical
poem of “The Recluse,” designed to
give an account of the growth of his own mind, and
to develop all the peculiarities, poetical, ethical and
religious, of his system of thought. A large portion
of this remains unpublished, but the second part was
issued in quarto, in 1814, under the title of “The
Excursion,” and was immediately lighted upon by
all the wit-snappers and critics of the old school, and
mercilessly “probed, vexed and criticised.” Jeffrey,
who began his celebrated review of it in the Edinburgh
with the sentence, “This will never do,”
was successful in ridiculing some of its weak points,
but made the mistake of stigmatizing its sublimest
passages as “unintelligible ravings.” The choice
of a pedler as the hero of a philosophical poem,
though it was based on facts coming within the
author’s knowledge, was a violation of ideal laws,
because it had not sufficient general truth to justify
the selection. A pedler may be a poet, moralist and
metaphysician, but such examples are for biography
rather than poetry, and indicate singularity more
than originality in the poet who chooses them.
Allowing for this error, substracting some puerile
lines, and protesting against the tendency to diffusion
in the style, “The Excursion” still remains as
a noble work, rich in description, in narrative, in
sentiment, fancy and imagination, and replete with
some of the highest and rarest attributes of poetry.
To one who has been an attentive reader of it, grand
and inspiring passages crowd into the memory at
the mere mention of its title. It is, more perhaps
than any other of Wordsworth’s works, enveloped
in the atmosphere of his soul, and vital with his individual
life; and in all sympathetic minds, in all
minds formed to feel its solemn thoughts and holy
raptures, it feeds</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“A calm, a beautiful, and silent fire.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The Excursion” was followed, in 1815, by the
“White Doe of Rylstone,” a narrative poem, which
Jeffrey said deserved the distinction of being the
worst poem ever printed in a quarto volume, and
which appears to us one of the very best. We do
not believe the “White Doe” is much read, and its
exceeding beauty, subtle grace, and profound significance,
are not perceived in a hasty perusal. It is
instinct with the most refined and ethereal imagination,
and could have risen from the depths of no
mind in which moral beauty had not been organized
into moral character. Its tenderness, tempered by
“thoughts whose sternness makes them sweet,”
pierces into the very core of the heart. The purpose
of the poem is to exhibit suffering as a purifier
of character, and the ministry of sympathies,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Aloft ascending, and descending quite</p>
<p class='line0'>Even unto inferior kinds,”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>in allaying suffering; and this is done by a story
sufficiently interesting of itself to engage the attention,
apart from its indwelling soul of holiness. In
the representation of the Nortons we have the best
specimens of Wordsworth’s power of characterization,
a power in which he is generally deficient, but
which he here exhibits with almost dramatic force
and objectiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peter Bell” and “The Wagoner,” which appeared
in 1819, were executed in a spirit very different
from that which animates the “White Doe.”
They were originally written to illustrate a system,
and seem to have been published, at this period, to
furnish the enemies of Wordsworth some plausible
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
excuse for attacking his growing reputation. “Peter
Bell” was conceived and composed as far back as
1798, and though it exhibits much power and refinement
of imagination, the treatment of the story is
essentially ludicrous. But still it contains passages
of description which are eminently Wordsworthian,
and which the most accomplished of Wordsworth’s
defamers never equaled. With what depth, delicacy,
sweetness and simplicity are the following verses,
for instance, conceived and expressed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wagoner,” is altogether unworthy of
Wordsworth’s genius. It is an attempt of a poet
without humor to be gay and jocular, and very dismal
gayety it is. But even this poem is not to be
dismissed without a reference to its one exquisite
passage—that in which he describes the obligation
upon him to write it:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Nor is it I who play the part,</p>
<p class='line0'>But a <span class='it'>shy spirit</span> in my heart,</p>

<p class='line0'>From hiding-places ten year’s deep;</p>
<p class='line0'>Or haunts me with familiar face,</p>
<p class='line0'>Returning, like a ghost unlaid,</p>
<p class='line0'>Until the debt I owe be paid.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The next volume of Wordsworth was a series of
sonnets, under the general title of “The River Duddon,”
published in 1820, and singularly pure in style
and fresh in conception. This was followed, in 1821,
by “Itinerary Sonnets,” chronicling a journey to
the Continent; “Ecclesiastical Sonnets,” in 1822,
celebrating events and characters in the history of
the English church; and “Yarrow Revisited, and
other Poems,” in 1834. In old age he still preserved
his young love for nature, and lost none of his power
of interpreting her teachings. In a poem entitled
“Devotional Incitements,” written at the age of
sixty-two, and distinguished for the delicate keenness
of its insight, no less than its lyric rapture, it
will be perceived that natural objects were still
visible and audible to his heart and imagination.
“Where,” he exclaims,</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the death of Southey, Wordsworth was appointed
Poet Laureate. The latter years of his life
were passed in undisturbed serenity, and he appears
to have retained his faculties to the last. His old
age, like his youth and mature manhood, illustrated
the truth of his poetic teachings, and proves that
poetry had taught him the true theory of life. One
cannot contemplate him during the last ten years
of his existence, without being forcibly impressed
with his own doctrine regarding the lover of nature:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Thy thoughts and feelings shall not die,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor leave thee when old age is nigh</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A melancholy slave;</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>But an old age serene and bright,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And lovely as a Lapland night,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>Shall lead thee to thy grave.</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The predominating characteristic of Wordsworth’s
poetry is thoughtfulness, a thoughtfulness in which
every faculty of his mind and every disposition of
his heart meet and mingle; and the result is an atmosphere
of thought, giving a softening charm to all the
objects it surrounds and permeates. This atmosphere
is sometimes sparklingly clear, as if the airs and
dews and sunshine of a May morning had found a
home in his imagination; but, in his philosophical
poems, where he penetrates into a region of thought
above the ken of ordinary mortals, this atmosphere
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
is touched by an ideal radiance which slightly obscures
as well as consecrates the objects seen through
it, and occasionally it thickens into mystical obscurity.
No person can thoroughly enjoy Wordsworth
who does not feel the subtle spirit of this atmosphere
of thought, as it communicates an air of freshness
and originality even to the commonplaces of his
thinking, and apparels his loftier conceptions in
celestial light—</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“The gleam,</p>
<p class='line0'>The light that never was on sea or land,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The consecration and the poet’s dream.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The first and grandest exercise, therefore, of his
imagination is the creation of this harmonizing atmosphere,
enveloping as it does the world of his creation
with that peculiar light and air, indescribable
but unmistakable, which enable us at once to recognize
and to class a poem by Wordsworth. We do
not hesitate to say that, in its peculiarity, there is
nothing identical with it in literature—that it constitutes
an absolutely new kind of poetry, in the
Platonic sense of the word kind. An imagination
which thus fuse all the faculties and emotions
into one individuality, so that all the vital products
of that individuality are characterized by unity of
effect, is an imagination of the highest <span class='it'>kind</span>. The
next question to be considered is the variety which
this unity includes; for Shakspeare himself, the most
comprehensively creative of human beings, never
goes beyond the unity of his individuality, his multifarious
variety always answering to the breadth of
his personality. He is like the banyan tree in the
marvelous fertility of his creativeness, and the province
of humanity he covers; but the fertility all
comes from one root and trunk, and indicates simply
the greatness of the <span class='it'>kind</span>, as compared with other
<span class='it'>kinds</span> of trees. The variety in the operation of
Wordsworth’s imagination we will consider first in
its emotional, and second in its intellectual, manifestation—of
course, using these words as terms of
distinction, not of division, because when we employ
the word imagination we desire to imply a
fusion of the whole nature of the man into one living
power. In the emotional operation of Wordsworth’s
imagination we discern his Sentiment. No term
has been more misused than this, its common acceptation
being a weak affectionateness; and, at
best, it is considered as an instinct of the sensibility,
as a simple, indivisible element of humanity. The
truth is that sentiment is a complex thing, the issue
of sensibility and imagination; and without imagination
sentiment is impossible. We often meet excellent
and intelligent people, whose affections are
warm, whose judgments are accurate, and whose
lives are irreproachable, but who lack in their religion,
morality and affections an elusive something
which is felt to be the grace of character. The
solution of the problem is found in their want of
sentiment—in their want of that attribute by which
past scenes and events, and absent faces, and remote
spiritual realities, affect the mind like objects which
are visibly present. Now, without this Sentiment
no man can be a poet, either in feeling or faculty;
and Wordsworth has it in a transcendent degree.
In him it is revealed, not only in his idealizing
whatever in nature or life had passed into his
memory, but in his religious feeling and in his creative
art. Scenes which he had viewed years before,
he tells us, still</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Flash</span> upon that <span class='it'>inward eye</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Which is the bliss of solitude.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Thus Sentiment is that operation of imagination
which recalls, in a more vivid light, things absent
from the bodily eye, and makes them act upon the
will with more force and inspiration than they originally
exerted in their first passionate or thoughtful
perception; and from its power of extracting the
essence and heightening the beauty of what has
passed away from the senses and passed into memory,
it gives the impulse which sends the creative
imagination far beyond the boundaries of actual life
into the regions of the ideal, to see what is most
beautiful here</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;—Imaged there</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;An ampler ether, a diviner air,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And fields invested with purpureal gleams,</p>
<p class='line0'>Climes, which the sun, who sheds the brightest day</p>
<p class='line0'>Earth knows, <span class='it'>is all unworthy</span> to survey.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is needless to adduce passages to prove the depth
and delicacy of Wordsworth’s sentiment, sanctifying
as it does natural objects and the humblest life, and
lending to his religious faith a mysterious, ineffable
beauty and holiness. In our view of the quality it
must necessarily be the limitation of a poet’s creativeness,
for the imagination cannot represent or
create objects to which it does not tend by a sentiment;
and Wordsworth, while he has a sentiment
for visible nature, a religious sentiment, a sentiment
of humanity, is still confined to the serious side of
things, and has no sentiment of humor. If he had
humor as a sentiment, he, dowered as he is with
imagination, would have it as a creative faculty, for
humor is the intellectual imagination inspired by the
sentiment of mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us now survey the power and scope of Wordsworth’s
imagination, considered in its intellectual
manifestation. Here nothing bounds its activity but
its sentiments. It is descriptive, pictorial, reflective,
shaping, creative, and ecstatic; it can body forth abstract
ideas in sensible imagery; it can organize, as
in “The White Doe,” a whole poem round one
central idea; it can make audible in the melody of
words, shades of feeling and thought which elude
the grasp of imagery; it can fuse and diffuse itself
at pleasure, animating, coloring, vitalizing every
thing it touches. In description it approaches near
absolute perfection, giving not only the scene as it
lies upon the clear mirror of the perceptive imagination,
but representing it in its life and motion as
well as form. The following, from “The Night
Piece,” is one out of a multitude of instances:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He looks up—the clouds are split</p>
<p class='line0'>Asunder—and above his head he sees</p>
<p class='line0'>The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens.</p>
<p class='line0'>There, in a black blue vault she sails along,</p>
<p class='line0'>Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small</p>
<p class='line0'>And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss</p>
<p class='line0'>Drive as she drives.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
In the description of the appearance of the White
Doe, we have not only form, hue and motion, but
the feeling of wonder that the fair creature excites,
and the rhythm which musically expresses the supernatural
character of the visitant—all embodied in
one vivid picture:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>The only voice that you can hear</p>
<p class='line0'>Is the river murmuring near.</p>

<p class='line0'>Where is no living thing to be seen;</p>
<p class='line0'>And through yon gateway, where is found,</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath the arch with ivy bound,</p>
<p class='line0'>Free entrance to the church-yard ground—</p>

<p class='line0'>And beauteous as the silver moon</p>
<p class='line0'>When out of sight the clouds are driven</p>
<p class='line0'>And she is left alone in heaven;</p>
<p class='line0'>Or like a ship, some gentle day,</p>
<p class='line0'>In sunshine sailing far away,</p>
<p class='line0'>A glittering ship that hath the plain</p>
<p class='line0'>Or ocean for her own domain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following we have a mental description, so

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>And she has smiles to earth unknown,</p>
<p class='line0'>Smiles that, with motion of their own,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Do spread and sink and rise;</p>
<p class='line0'>That come and go, with endless play,</p>
<p class='line0'>And ever as they pass away,</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is from the little poem to “Louisa.” It is
curious that Wordsworth, in the octavo edition of
his works, published when he was seventy-seven
years old, omits this stanza. It was so refined that
he had probably lost the power to perceive its delicate
beauty, and dismissed it as meaningless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In describing nature as connected with, and embodied
in, human thoughts and sentiments, Wordsworth’s
descriptive power rises with the complexity
of the theme. Thus, in the poem of Ruth, we have
an example of the perversion of her energizing
power:</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most common exercise of Wordsworth’s
imagination is what we may call its meditative action—its
still, calm, searching insight into spiritual
truth, and into the spirit of nature. In these, analysis
and reflection become imaginative, and the “more
than reasoning mind” of the poet overleaps the boundaries
of positive knowledge, and, steadying itself
on the vanishing points of human intelligence, scans
the “life of things.” In the poems in which meditation
predominates, there is a beautiful union of
tender feeling with austere principles, and this austerity
prevents his tenderness from ever becoming
morbid. As his meditative poems more especially
relate to practice, and contain his theory of life, they
grow upon a studious reader’s mind with each new
perusal. In them the Christian virtues and graces
are represented in something of their celestial beauty
and power, and the poet’s “vision and faculty divine”
are tasked to the utmost in giving them vivid
and melodious expression. He is not, in this meditative
mood, a mere moralizing dreamer, a vague
and puerile rhapsodist, as some have maliciously
asserted, but a true poetic philosopher, whose
wisdom is alive with the throbs of holy passion,
and</p>

<p class='line0'>Beauty—a living Presence of the earth—</p>
<p class='line0'>Surpassing the most fair ideal Forms</p>
<p class='line0'>Which craft of delicate spirits hath composed</p>
<p class='line0'>From earth’s materials—waits upon his steps;</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though these poems are essentially meditative
in spirit, they are continually verging on two forms
of the highest poetic expression, abstract imagination
and ecstasy; and the clear, serene, intense
vision which is their ordinary characteristic, is the
appropriate mood out of which such forms of imagination
naturally proceed. Let us first give a
specimen of the creativeness of his imagination in
its calmly contemplative mood, and we will select
one of his many hundred sonnets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, however, in the sublime “Ode on the Intimations
of Immortality from the Recollections of
Childhood,” that we best perceive the power of
Wordsworth’s imagination in all the various modes
of its expression—descriptive, analytic, meditative,
interpretative, abstract and ecstatic; and in this ode
each of these modes helps the other; the grand choral
harmonies of the rapturous upward movement
seeming to be born out of the intense contemplation,
that hovers dizzily over the outmost bounds of human
conception, to scrutinize, in the dim dawn of
consciousness,</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no space to particularize the felicity of
Wordsworth’s muse in dealing with the affections,
or the depth and power of his pathos. Before
leaving the subject of his genius, however, we cannot
withhold a reference to his “Ode on the Power
of Sound,” which appears to be little known even
to readers of the poet, though in the thronging
abundance of its ideas and images, in the exquisite
variety of its music, and in the soul of imagination
which animates it throughout, it yields the palm to
no ode in the language.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wordsworth is most assuredly not a popular poet
in the sense in which Moore and Byron are popular;
and he probably never will be so among those readers
who do not distinguish between being passionate
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
and being impassioned, and who prefer the strength
of convulsion to the strength of repose; readers who
will attend only to what stirs and startles the sensibility,
who read poetry not for its nourishing but its
inflaming qualities, and who look upon poetic fire as
properly consuming the mind it animates. Wordsworth
is not for them, except they go to him as a
spiritual physician, in search of “balm for hurt
minds.” Placed in a period of time when great
passions in the heart generated monstrous paradoxes
in the brain, he clung to those simple but essential
elements of human nature on which true power and
true elevation must rest; and, while all around him
sounded the whine of sentimentality and the hiss
of Satanic pride, his mission, like that of his own
beautiful blue streamlet, the Duddon, was “to heal
and cleanse, not madden and pollute.” His rich
and radiant imagination cast its consecrating and
protecting light on all those dear immunities of humanity,
which others were seeking to discard for
the delusions of haughty error, or the fancies of ripe
sensations. Accordingly, though many other poets
of the time have a fiercer or fonder charm for young
and unrestrained minds, he alone grows upon and
grows into the intellect, and “hangs upon the beatings
of the heart,” as the soul advances in age and
reflection; for there is a rich substance of spiritual
thought in his poetry to meet the wants of actual
life—consolations for sorrow, help for infirmity,
sympathy for bereavement, a holy gleam of awful
splendor to irradiate the dark fear of death; a poetry,
indeed, which purifies as well as pleases, and penetrates
into the vitalities of our being as wisdom no
less than loveliness:</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you find them all at home, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hearty, ma’am, thank ye;” and the girl moved
busily about the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was my chambermaid, and although she had
only lived with me a little while, I felt very much
attached to her, for she was so kind, industrious and
honest. Soon after she came to us I was seized with
a painful illness, and during it, she nursed me with
the tenderness of a sister; often, when the spasms
of acute pain would shake my feeble body, I had
seen large tears standing in her full, round eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she assisted me in undressing, I observed that
she was not in her usual spirits, and when she
handed me my dressing-gown, I saw that her hands
trembled. But she patiently went through every
little duty, although I could well see that she was
suffering from some hidden trouble. When I sat
down to my reading, she left me to prepare for me
some tea—for, dear reader, I am a true old maid, and
love my cup of tea, as well as I love my existence
almost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she re-entered, and rolling a little teapoy
beside my chair, she placed on it the waiter, and
poured out my tea. Just then I heard the heavy
breathing of my dear Aunt Mary, who was asleep
in the adjoining room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close the door of Aunt Mary’s room, my good
Bridget,” I said; “and while I drink my tea and eat
this nice piece of toast you have made me, come and
tell me something about Ireland.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I knew this would please her; for often had she
talked to me at night, when I would be undressing,
about the glens and vales of beautiful, song-famed
Coleraine; and the fairies, with their round rings in
the grass. She had never seen a fairy her own self,
but “Elsie the child” her sister had, and the “<span class='it'>little
body</span>,” as she called the fairy, had pinched the poor
“<span class='it'>wean</span> Elsie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then again on Sunday, or holyday nights, she
would tell me how, when a child, she had wished
to be a nun, and that she would go out in the dark,
pitch night, and kneel on the ground in the middle
of their garden, and ask the good Virgin and the
Saints to pray for her—for Bridget has always been
a religious girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she had actually heard the Benshee cry.
It came wailing around the house when her father
died; and she had heard it a week before his death,
when he was hale and hearty. She had heard it at
night-fall one evening when she was crossing the
glen below their cottage, as she was coming from
Coleraine, where she had been spending the day with
her grandmother. It commenced “low and mournful
like” in the bushes beside her, and then ranged
around the hills, swelling out louder and louder, until
it ceased behind the cottage. As she would dwell
on this, my fancy would picture to me the enthusiastic,
imaginative Irish girl, standing with lips
apart, listening to this mournful wailing night-wind,
which her after troubles shaped into the sad poetical
Benshee; and if I had had the skill of an artist, I would
have made a lovely sketch, I am sure; for so plainly
did her descriptions bring before me her figure and
the surrounding landscape, lightened with the warm
hue of the lingering twilight so peculiar to Ireland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget sat down on the rug beside me, and when
we went to bed that night, good reader, it was later
than unsuspecting Aunt Mary imagined; but I had
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
heard all Bridget’s troubles, had soothed and comforted
her, had read her lover’s last letter to her—for
she had a lover—what girl has not?—and sent her
to bed with a heart considerably lighter than when,
with aching head but patient fingers, she had prepared
my nice night meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget’s father, Dermot Kerevan, was a Scotchman
by birth, but of Irish parentage. His father had
settled in Glasgow, and there did Dermot spend his
early years, and obtain thriftiness and steadiness, qualities
not often found in an Irishman. Dermot was early
apprenticed to a gardener, and when he was out of his
term of service, his master recommended him to an
Irish gentleman, who wanted a gardener for his place,
“The Forest,” at Coleraine. There Dermot came,
and it was not long before he brought home to his
pretty gardener’s-cottage, the beauty of Coleraine,
Grace Mullen, who he had persuaded to be his
“<span class='it'>bonnie wife</span>,” as he called her. They must have
been very happy—for sweeter domestic pictures
I have never heard described, either in tale or poem,
than my good Bridget would sketch in her little
stories of their home, during her father’s life. But
this blessed happiness could not last for ever. One
fine spring day poor Dermot was brought home
from the garden, up at “the great house,” on a litter,
nearly dead. He had fallen from a high tree while
lopping off a branch. He lingered only a few hours,
leaving the lonely widow with her “four childer,”
to battle with life alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget was the eldest, and she was only twelve.
Then there was Grace, and Elsie, and little Jinny,
the baby, all to be cared for. Bridget was sent to
her uncle’s at Glasgow town, and the grandmother
of Grace Kerevan gave the shelter of her poor roof to
the rest of them. Widow Kerevan opened a little
shop in her grandmother’s front room, and did “bits
of work for the people all around Coleraine,” as
Bridget expressed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year after the kind, loving father’s death, home
came Bridget from Glasgow town. Her uncle, the
rich distiller, was enraged at her, for she had told
his wife she had rather starve in Ireland than go to
the meeting-house all day Sunday, and sit straight up
at her sewing and knitting the rest of the week.
Poor girl! the strict, rigid habits of her uncle’s thrifty
Scotch wife had driven her almost frantic. She,
who had roamed at will, over hill and glen, and
had never been bound down to any duty. The
domestic affairs of her own home had always been
soon dispensed with, and she had spent most of her
time in rambling through the forest, or by the stream-side,
or playing with Gracey, Elsie, and the baby,
chasing their shadows on the grassy hill-side; then
how could she bear the strait-laced notions and rules
of her notable Scotch aunt? Not at all, and she told
her so; and they sent her home to the starvation her
aunt had often taunted her with, holding it in perspective,
when she would be rebellious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother, grandmother, and children crowded
around her. Grace Kerevan held her child, from
whom she had been so long parted, close to her
bosom, and sobbed with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so,” said the old grandmother, “the ‘Scotch
<span class='it'>quean</span>,’ as poor Dermot used to say, told ye we
starved here? Never mind, darlint, ye shall always
have a p’raty, even if we all do without.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Bridget worked early and late, for the farmers’
wives, but she only made a “small thrifle,” as she
said, and sometimes they were so poor that they had
scarcely a potato apiece in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did you ever wish yourself back in Glasgow
town, Bridget?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Niver, ma’am,” was the girl’s energetic answer;
and I do not believe she ever did, for the genial light
of home-love shone in her poor, Irish home, for
which her little affectionate heart had pined, under
the wealthier but cold roof of her uncle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thin I came to Ameriky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Bridget, how came you to think of America?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Och, the girls all around talked about Ameriky,
and my aunt’s cousin’s husband’s sister writ home a
letter about her making such a power of money.
Well, I talked to mother about it, but she cried, and
so did grandmother, and they asked me where I’d
get the four pound to pay my passage with. That
kept me quiet a bit, for I’d niver seen so big a heap
of money. But one day, when I was shaking up
grandmother’s bed, I felt a great big lump in it, that
was sewed up in the straw, and I dragged it out, and
it was an old stocking with money tied in it. I ran
screamin’ with joy to mother. But och, how she
cried and grandmother scolded. Then I cried, too,
and grandmother came and hugged me, and told me
to give over cryin’, that there was the money if I
wanted it. She said she’d hid it away in the bed,
years agone, to keep off the dark day. Then I cried,
‘Grandmother, let me go ’till Ameriky, and I will
send ye so much gold that’ll keep the dark day
away forever.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then mother said, ‘Let the girl go, for sure she’s
had light given her, and she knows better than us.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not feel a little sorry, Bridget, when
they gave up at last?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, not a bit,” she continued; “and I
hurried around and got ready. The girl that had
writ the letters home about Ameriky, sent out a
ticket to her sister to come on the vessel that was
just going; but she—Rosy McLanahan it was—was
very sick, and couldn’t go; and so mother bought
her ticket for me. But, och, when mother bid me
good bye, and kissed me, and left me on the vessel,
then I cried. I didn’t cry a bit when I bid grandmother
and the childer good bye at the house, but it
was when I saw mother going down the side of the
vessel, and get into the tumbling little boat, that I
cried. I felt so lonely like, just as I did when father
was buried; and I watched the little boat, and her
red cloak, until she got ashore. Then there she
stood, and shook her handkerchief until it growed
too dark to see her. Och, Miss Enna, but then I
cried—all to myself though—for I was ashamed the
people should see me, and I went off to my little bed
and cried all night; for I thought I was furder away
from them than father was, for he was in heaven, and
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
I was out on wide wather. Then I thought of what
father used to tell me about God bein’ with us always,
and I tried to stop my cryin’ by prayin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old were you then, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite fifteen, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you not glad when you saw America, my
poor child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indade and indade I was, for I’d been so sick all
the way, and when the vessel came up the river to
Philadelphia, I cried with joy. But when the vessel
anchored, and people came from shore, and I heerd
them a greetin’ one another, my heart fell like a great
lump of lead, for I’d nobody in this wild, new country
to greet me. Then I cried again, but it was with
the heart-ache. I sat there all alone, when one of
the women, who had been very kind to me on the
passage, came up to me, and she brought with her a
man, who, she said, used to know my mother when
she was a slip of a girl in Coleraine, and if I would
go home with him, he would try to find me a place.
I bundled up my clothes, which were only a few
pieces, and went with him. This was on a Saturday
night like, Miss Enna, and on Monday they took me
to a place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it a nice place, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am; but ’twas a plain, hard-working
family; they kept only me, and they had a lot of
childer and a whole parcel of apprentice boys; but
Mrs. Hill—that was her name—was kind to me, and
worked with me when she could, and took good care
of my money, which she put all away, and I didn’t
spend a bit. She giv’ me some of her old dresses
and an old hood, so I saved up all my money for
four months. Then I writ my first letter to mother,
and sent her the sixteen dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bridget!” I exclaimed, “why did you not
write before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed quietly, and replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to send a big bit of money when I writ
home; and I know’d the neighbors would stare, and
grandmother would open her eyes, and mother would
be so proud of her Bridget sendin’ home three pound
and over. Then came a letter from them at home,
and it made me cry so. They were all well, and
had got my money; but mother tried to scold a bit
bekase I hadn’t writ before, but she was so plased
to hear I was doin’ well, that she didn’t scold much.
Then I worked on, but I felt lonely like, and kept
thinkin’ how nice ’twould be to have Gracey with
me. So I saved up twenty dollars, and sent it to
Ireland; and soon Gracey came to me. Mother
couldn’t come, I know’d, for grandmother was so
old as to stay in bed all the time. I’d been a year
in Ameriky when Gracey came over; then after
awhile I sent for Elsie, for the times were still harder
in Ireland, and mother had bad work to get on with
her poor old sick granny to nurse. Elsie seemed so
little when she came, that I didn’t know what to
do with her; but Mrs. Hill, the kind soul, said she
might come and live with me; that she could play
with the childer, and rock the cradle, and go errands,
and she would give her her clothes the first year;
then, if she was smart, she would give her a half
dollar a week—for Mr. Hill was richer now. I took
great pleasure in Elsie, she was good and minded
me; but Gracey was headstrong like, and would
have her own way. She gave me a dale of trouble,
and many’s the night I’ve laid awake and thought
about her. She liked to taze me, and make me believe
she was worse than she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last Mr. Hill and his wife made up their minds
to buy a large farm clear up in the country, a great
many miles off from Philadelphia, and Elsie and me
went with them. This did Gracey good, and she
was a better girl ever afterward, for when she was
left alone in Philadelphia, she saw how cross she’d
been to me, and this made her sorry; and she went
to church rigilar, and attended to her duties, and
used to go and talk to my good old priest, Father
Shane, for he writ about it to me, unbeknownst to
her—och, but I was glad thin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After I’d been in the country—on the farm, I
mane—a letter came from mother, telling us of poor
grandmother’s death, and the letter had all tears over
it, which made Elsie and me cry, for we know’d
they were poor mother’s tears. In this same letter
she said she wished we could send her a ticket to
come to Ameriky with; that if she could only see
her Bridget once more before she died, she would be
happy. This was spring-time, so I takes up Elsie’s
money and mine, and goes off to Philadelphia to buy
a ticket for mother and show Gracey mother’s letter.
Gracey had no money to give me, for she was always
extravagant; and no wonder, for she was pretty, like
mother, and liked a bit of finery better than plain
folks like myself. She cried about it, but I comforted
her, and told her niver mind, I’d enough; but I
couldn’t buy myself a dress—that I didn’t let her
know though for fear she’d fret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I bought the ticket, and got Father Shane to
write a letter for me. I was going to stay in Philadelphia
a week—so Mrs. Hill said I might; but the
day after I bought the ticket, a wagon came all the
way from the farm to tell me Elsie was dying—that
she had sickened the day I left, and had the measles.
Then again, Miss Enna, I was in trouble, for Elsie
was so good, and she looked like father. Och, I
cried all the way out to Mrs. Hill’s. Sure enough,
when I got there my poor baby was near gone. I
nursed her night and day, poor child, but ’twas no
use, God took my <span class='it'>wean</span> away from me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night she died she opened her eyes and
know’d me for the first time. I thought she was
getting well, though the doctor said she couldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Bridget,’ siz she, ‘we’d a nice play down in
the glen, hadn’t we!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t answer, my heart was so full, for I
saw she thought she was home in Coleraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Bridget!’ she called, and held out her little
hands to me. I took her in my arms, cryin’ all the
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Let’s go into the cottage,’ siz she, ‘for father
and grandmother have been callin’ us a good many
times. It’s dark out here, Bridget, and cold—hold
me, Bridget, dear, for I can’t see.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she called ‘mother!’ and tryin’ to put her
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
little arms around my neek, said she wanted to go to
sleep, and told me to sing to her. I hugged her close
up to me, and after a few words about the long
grass under the hill by the cottage, where she and
Jinny used to roll over playin’, she drew a long
breath, and as I kissed her, she died. Och, but that
was the darkest night I iver spent, Miss Enna. I was
all alone, for Mrs. Hill had gone to sleep, tellin’ me I
must call her if Elsie was worse. There I sat all
night holdin’ my dead darlint close to my bosom, too
heart-struck to cry. But when in the morning Mrs.
Hill tried to take her from me, they say I screamed
and held on to her like a mad person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I niver saw Elsie afterward, Miss Enna,” said
the poor girl, with tears streaming down her cheeks,
“for when they buried her in the cold earth, I was
raving sick, and they said I would die too. Part of
the time I know’d them, and part of the time I was
crazy, but when I’d my sinses, I prayed God would
just keep me alive to see my mother. He heard my
prayer,” she continued, crossing herself devoutly,
“and before mother came I was well again, though
my heart was full of sorrow for Elsie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I sent for mother, I told her not to come
till fall, for I thought by that time I’d lay by a trifle
of money to take a room in Philadelphia and buy some
furniture. All summer I worked hard, and Mrs. Hill,
the good soul, give me as much money in the fall as
if Elsie had been workin’ too. She know’d what I
wanted with it, and she give me some old chairs,
and a bed, too. I was sorry to leave her, for her and
her husband was kind to us always; but I know’d
mother would feel lonely like in town without me.
So I packed up all my things, and came in Mr.
Hill’s market-wagon to town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Shane had writ to me that the vessel was
expected in a week or so—and I came to town just
in time to rent a nice room for mother. I’d enough
of money to pay a month’s rint ahead, and to buy
some wood. Then I bought a carpet and a nice bedstead,
and a table, and a good, warm stove—oh, yes,
and a <span class='it'>cushioned form</span>, or sofy, as the people call it
here, that looked like the one we had at home in
Coleraine. Gracey give me a little trifle, which was
a grate dale for her, seein’ it had been summer-time,
and she had to have a new bonnet, bein’ in town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The night before mother came, Gracey ran
round from her place to see mother’s room, and how
proud I felt, as we stood in the middle of it, and
looked around at all the things—we felt so rich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Now, if we only had a bureau,’ said Gracey,
‘to put under that little glass of mine.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracey had always finer notions than me. I’d
niver thought a bit of a bureau, for I know’d mother
had a chist which would hold Jinny’s clothes and
hers—all they had, poor things. Father Shane
came to see me that night, too, and brought a big,
black, wood cross to hang over the mantlepiece, and
a string of beads for Jinny. Och, but we felt very
happy, only every little bit, poor Elsie would come
to my mind, and I’d think of how merry she’d been
if she’d been livin’; and grate tears would roll down
in spite of me. Father Shane spoke very pretty
about her, and made me feel better, and after he and
Gracey went away, I sat down by the stove, and
there I sat all night, for I didn’t want to rumple the
bed I’d made up for mother, for the sheets looked
so white and smooth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next afternoon the vessel came up the river,
but it was ten o’clock at night before mother got off.
There I stood on the wharf, talkin’ to her, that was
on the ould vessel, all the evenin’. When she first
see’d me, she cried,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Och, and it’s my Bridget, God bless her!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was so glad, she’d have tumbled overboard,
but for one of the sailors who caught her. We both
cried and laughed, and some laughed at us; but the
good sailor who had caught ahold of her when she
was fallin’, told her to cheer up, that she’d soon be
on shore with her Bridget. He helped her down
the side of the vessel, and when she hugged me and
we both cried, I saw him wipe his eyes. He shook
hands with us both, and asked where we lived, and
said he’d come to see us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, och, didn’t mother stare when she see’d
her nice room. Then she throw’d her apron over
her head and cried like a baby. Jinny had grow’d
so tall I didn’t know her. I was glad she was tall,
for I’d hated to see her, for fear she’d make me cry
about Elsie, bein’ little like her; but she was near
as tall as Gracey, and right pretty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother examined all the room, and kissed me,
and hugged me, and then, when Gracey came, she
looked very proud—for Gracey was so fine lookin’.
Gracey staid all night, and we made her and Jinny
a bed on the floor with the cushions of the <span class='it'>form</span>, for
mother said she’d sleep with her Bridget. We
talked nearly all night, and we all cried about Elsie,
and I told ’em a great many pretty stories about her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Yes, mother,’ said Gracey, ‘Elsie, the darlin’,
was always a blessin’ to Bridget, but I was a trouble.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made her hush, and told her she wasn’t as bad
as she pretended to be, and then after a bit we all
went to sleep. But after I’d been asleep awhile I
wakened, and there was mother lanin’ over me
cryin’ and kissin’ me; I didn’t ope my eyes, but laid
so still; for oh, Miss Enna, it was so nice to have my
own mother beside me, and then I was afraid I was
dramin’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bridget,” I said, as the girl wiped her
eyes, “how did you support your little family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very azy, ma’am,” she replied, “for we all took
care of ourselves. Mrs. Hill came in and asked Jinny
to go and live with her. Then I got a nice place at
poor Mrs. Kenyon’s mother’s. You know’d Mrs.
Kenyon, Miss Enna, ’twas she who died?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed I did know her, for Mary Kenyon had been
one of my dearest friends, and only a few short
months before the grave had closed over her—the
beautiful and the good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” continued Bridget, “after a bit I got
mother two nice first-floor rooms, at the corner of
the street where she lived; and in the front one she
opened a little store, which kept her nicely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now came the romance—the love-story of
good, innocent Bridget’s life. Her lover was the
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
good, kind-hearted sailor who had been so interested
in them when widow Kerevan landed. He came
to see them as he had promised, and though Bridget
and the widow thought that Gracey’s pretty curls
and bright eyes brought him so often “<span class='it'>o’ evenin’s</span>,”
they soon found out it was the good Bridget he was
after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s three years now gone, since we were ingaged,”
said Bridget, “and nearly that since I have
seen or heerd tell of him,” and she sighed heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did he go to, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, ma’am, he went in a states government
vessel to the Ingees, and he said he’d write to me;
but I’ve niver had a line from him since he sailed.
He writ a letter to me at Norfolk town just before he
went off, and told me to love him true ’til he came
back, then we’d be man and wife. Mother long
since wanted me to take another beau, for she sez
I’m gettin’ old, and bein’ plain like, nobody will
have me, then I’ll be an old maid that nobody likes
or cares for; but I’d sooner be an old maid, than
brake my vow to Patrick; and even Father Shane
has scolded mother and Gracey about it, for they
both taze me—and he sez I’m right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean break your vow, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why you see, Miss Enna, both Patrick and I
loved old Ireland so much that we rigilarly ingaged
ourselves, like the people used to in the old country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How was that, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patrick takes a Prayer-book the night before he
went away, and stood in the middle of mother’s
room, and swore on it by the holy cross, that he
niver would marry any woman but me, Bridget
Kerevan; och, but his oath was so solemn and
beautiful, it made me tremble all over. Then he
puts the Prayer-book in my lap, and we took hold of
each other’s hands over it, and I made the same
vow, and then we both kissed the book. Mother
and Gracey were by and heerd it all. How can I,
then, Miss Enna, even if I wanted to, take another
beau? And I’m sure if any thing happens to him
I shall niver want another beau, for he was my first
real one, and he seemed to come right in Elsie’s
place like in my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she sighed heavily, I comforted her, by telling
her she was perfectly right in keeping good faith to
the absent Patrick; that she need not mind if they
did trouble her, it was better to suffer annoyances
than give up to do wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” she continued, “they taxed me so
bekaze I wouldn’t have any thing to say to one of
the neighbor’s boys from Coleraine, who know’d us
when we were childer; and mother said it was her
belafe that Patrick was safe and happy somewhere
else, married to some other woman. This made me
very mad, and I started up and went out of the house
without sayin’ a word; but mother ran after me
down the street, and made me kiss her good-night,
and we made up and parted friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was right, Bridget, for she is your mother,
and though mistaken, she meant it for the best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that, Miss Enna, but they trouble me so
much, I sometimes hate to go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went softly up into her bed-room and
brought down a poor, worn-looking letter, and a
dilapidated book, with one cover off, and the leaves
part gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is his letter from Norfolk town, Miss Enna;
read it, plaze, aloud, for I niver tire hearin’ it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read it, and found it to be a manly, affectionate,
lover-like letter. He touchingly reminded her of her
vow, in homely, plain language, it is true, but real
heart words were they, that brought tears to my eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that book, Bridget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Enna,” replied the girl, looking down,
and her round face grew crimson, “it’s a book of
his’n. He used to be always readin’ in it; and one
day he throw’d it into my lap, and said, when I could
read it he’d give me a silk gownd fit for a quane to
wear. I laughed and thought nothin’ at all about it
until after he’d been gone above a year, when I
found it down at mother’s one night in my old chist,
which mother had given me when I’d bought her
the bureau poor Gracey wanted so bad. I’ve kept
the book iver since; and I take it out of my drawer
o’ nights, and sit down and try to see somethin’ in it,
but even if I could rade, which I can’t, I couldn’t
see nothin’ in it, for it always makes me cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took the book from her with great curiosity; I
was anxious to see what was the nature of it, for I
hoped to judge by it of the character of this sailor-lover.
It was Falconer’s Shipwreck. I was satisfied,
and was a firmer friend than before to Patrick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks afterward, one night Bridget came
home with a face perfectly radiant, or “<span class='it'>bamin</span>,” as
she would have said. I was reading in my bed-room
all alone. She came in, closed Aunt Mary’s
door, and giving me a letter, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rade it, dear Miss Enna, rade it; he’s alive, and
is comin’ home;” and she sat down on the rug beside
me, and laughed and cried at once as I read the
letter aloud to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sure enough, the lover was safe and true. He
had written to her often, but the letters had been lost,
he supposed, as he had never heard from her; but
he felt sure, he said, that she was still his Bridget,
even if he did not hear from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, you see, Miss Enna, how bad I’d been
if I’d done as they wanted me to,” she exclaimed;
“and so Father Shane said to mother to-night, when
he read the beautiful letter—for he brought it to me.
Patrick writ to him, and sint him this letter to me
inside of his’n, bekase he said he’d writ so often to
me, and sure a letter would rach me through Father
Shane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Patient Reader, this is a true story; but I am the
only one to be sympathized with in it, for I lost my
jewel of a chambermaid. A few months afterward
Patrick came home and claimed his faithful Bridget.
We had a busy time when she was married—for
the whole family took an interest in good Bridget’s
fortune. Patrick was a nice, healthy, bright-looking
Irishman; and when on the Sunday after he arrived
he came to take her to mass, I saw him as they
walked down the street together, look at her sturdy
little figure with as much admiration as if it had
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
possessed the fine proportions of a Venus. Love is
such a beautifier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Shane married them, and Patrick rented a
nice little house in the suburbs of our town, and took
Widow Kerevan home to live with them. Bridget
is a happy wife; but she has one trouble, and that
is, that her husband’s calling takes him away from
her, and places him in danger; but when he returns
from long voyages she is as bright and merry as a
lark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other day I went to see her, and as her little
girl Elsie came nestling close to me, Bridget said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever since that child was born, Miss Enna, I
feel that my blessed darlint has come back to me.
Och, but He’s been kind to me,” she said, blessing
herself with devotion, “for He give me back both
Patrick and Elsie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good girl! God had indeed been kind to her, for
he had bestowed upon her those priceless gifts of the
spirit—Faith and Truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was passing through a grove of budding maple
trees, thinking of you, of “Graham”—that is, wondering
what in all the world I could find to say, that
you would care to hear; a desperate mood for one
to be in, certes—when my meditations were disturbed
by the voice of a creature which came from the
heights above, chirping out, not softly, not musically,
but in a shrieking tone, as though bent on vociferous
disputation with somebody, “Katy <span class='it'>did</span>.” The spirit
of opposition roused within me as I heard that cry;
I was about to deny the assertion point blank, when
the sweet, tiny voice of another insect, answered
distinctly, “she didn’t.” It was like the acceptance
of a challenge in effect; forthwith the first
speaker began again, with increased energy, “Katy
did! Katy did—she did! she did! she did!” But
still the milder voice, quite undismayed, replied
valiantly, and with a solemn air of undoubtable truth,
“She didn’t.” The neighboring spirits were now
all aroused; never did mortal before hear such a rush
of sound as burst upon me then! A perfect flood of
abuse gushed from one throat, while distinct and
dignified denial met it all in reply. Asseverations
numberless, and uncharitable defamation of one,
powerless now to vindicate herself, followed. With
wonder and with <span class='it'>patience</span> I listened to the end; oh,
loveliest reader, will you do so likewise? Here is
the substance of that most strange <span class='it'>conversasionne</span>.</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'>Little Kitty Clover was the only child of her widowed
father—“a fine old English gentleman, all
of the olden time;” she was a blooming fairy of a
girl, spoiled, of course, and worshiped, too—a very
“household goddess.” Miserably educated had the
young thing been; for—only think of it!—at sixteen
years of age, she was as wild and free in spirit as a
chamois, as brave as a chamois-hunter, and through
the unpardonable neglect of those who had the care
of her, she had been taught nothing whatever of
sorrow, save the Dictionary definition—and <span class='it'>that</span>
she could scarcely comprehend. At this age she was
still under the care, or rather in the companionship,
of a governess, Lucy Freer, a lady also young, indeed
but two years older than her pupil; but <span class='it'>she</span> was
a dignified, commanding personage, (and thus differed
very much from Kitty;) a silent, sad, but remarkably
handsome girl, who sometimes wept, and never
laughed, (which was strange, for one would have
thought that the spirit of mirth dwelling in Kitty was
of an absolutely infectious nature;) but Lucy had the
sweetest of smiles when she was pleased or happy,
and that smile, with her unvarying goodness and
talent, secured from the first, the warm love of her
pupil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we have intimated, Kitty’s father had done all
that he possibly could to spoil his daughter, and the
labor in that way, it must be confessed, had been far
from vain; but fortunately, nature had given the girl a
warm, affectionate heart, and the training of her childhood
had not tended to make her half so selfish and exacting
as might in all reason have been expected. She
was innately frank and noble; and there was a clear
expression of her blue eyes, which told how honest
and sincere she was in all her thoughts and doings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Retired and unsuperficial as had been her way of
life, poor Kitty! she found occasion to fall “desperately
in love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after the governess made her home at
Woodland Cottage, in C——, a gentleman from
London came to call upon her. The pupil happened
to be present at the interview, and she heard
the stranger announce his intention of making his
home in the village; and the great evident satisfaction
of Lucy Freer, as <span class='it'>she</span> heard this determination,
did not escape the observation of the keen-eyed
Kitty; and having little else to think about for
several days, she indulged in wonderment as to
what kind of regard her governess could cherish for
the handsome man, that she should be so very light
of heart, so really joyous from the very moment of
his appearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eugene Lind, that was his name, was about thirty
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
years of age, as fine looking, stately, and elegant a
person as need be; he was a lawyer by profession,
but still more of a poet by choice. As the only acquaintance
he had in C—— was housed at Woodland,
he became at once a frequent guest at the cottage,
where he found always a genial host in Reginald
Clover; but the truth must be said, that though the old
man’s welcome was desirable, it was not him that the
lawyer really went or cared to see. This became
quite evident when, ere long, in view of his old
friendship for Lucy, he made bold to push his way
directly to the school-room, when his visits were
made in the day hours, which was oftenest the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no very marvelous wonder that Kitty
Clover, secluded as she was from the rest of the
world, save that minute portion of it that dwelt in
and just about her own home—it was no wonder, I say,
that, in the course of time she should have begun to
think quite as much of Mr. Lind as she did of her
grammar and mathematics; that she should even
prefer at last, <span class='it'>greatly</span> prefer, listening to his fine
readings and conversation to any other amusement.
But she did no more than listen, that is for a year,
till she was sixteen, and then Kitty had become so
accustomed to his presence, so cognizant of her own
powers of speech, as to find it really possible to talk
with, and to learn of him; and he was a wiser
teacher than Lucy even, for he imparted a high charm
to every book he laid his hands on—it became
“tabooed” immediately to the child’s apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! no longer did she sit then, a shy and silent
creature, in the great bow-window, pretending to
total abstraction from all things past, present, or
future, save what she found in the dry pages of her
book; but boldly, at least calmly, came she forward
to sit beside her governess, to meet the glances
of the poet-lawyer, to listen, and to speak with him
and Lucy, as a sane and intelligent being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it was that, day by day, and more and
more thoroughly, she learned to love him; so it was
that his words fell one by one, with creative power
on her heart, till the most radiant and glorious flower
sprung up there; but though its fragrance filled her
life with a beauty which she <span class='it'>felt</span>, she could not comprehend
it, did not at all understand it, till at last from
wondering she passed to knowledge, as she wakened
to see how very pale the governess was growing—how
languidly she carried forward the work of instruction—how
abstractedly she went about all her
tasks—how she neglected totally the volumes which
had once been her love companions—how she oftentimes
wept—how dull and dispirited she was when
Eugene Lind was not by, and how she invariably,
for a moment at least, brightened up and smiled when
he drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when poor Kitty’s eyes <span class='it'>were</span> opened, lovely
reader, they seemed good for nothing in the world
but to weep—just a vent for tears; for then she
knew—she could not <span class='it'>help</span> knowing—that Lucy Freer
loved the lawyer. And it was a terrible discovery
to make, was it not—for now, the child, what right
had <span class='it'>she</span> to think of him? She did not wonder for a
moment whether or no the love of the governess
was well-founded, whether or no he returned it;
she could only say to herself, “he has visited her
constantly, has exerted himself to be agreeable, and
it’s all his own fault and doing—he has no right, and
is too old to trifle so. Lucy is an orphan, and poor;
she is beautiful and good enough—yes, even for him!
I have a father, and am rich; he <span class='it'>ought</span> to love her,
and he shall tell her he <span class='it'>does</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so little Kate (recollect my world-fashioned
lady, all this happened a long time ago, and she had
learned her knowledge of life’s obligations only from
wild romances) felt that a duty devolved on her which
must be performed; and oh, how strenuously she
labored, how dispassionately she reasoned with herself,
that she might become strong to fulfill it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eugene had not visited the cottage for many days;
a Friday night came round, and for two whole
weeks he had absented himself. On this day, as by
mutual consent, the books were laid aside, the school-room
deserted, Lucy retired to her own room ill—certainly
at heart—and Kitty, silent and troubled, yet
stronger to bear her burden of sorrow, because she
felt that another suffered more than she, walked,
practiced her music, arranged flowers with the utmost
determination, and then, restless, but not knowing
what to do with herself, she wandered about the
house, quite as if in a dream, yet cautious as a somnambulist,
for how carefully she shunned the presence
and inquiring glances of her good old father.
She <span class='it'>was</span> dreaming—such a dream, indeed, as adds
years to the “inner life” of the young—dreaming of
bereavement, self-sacrifice, and death! even she,
that bright young girl!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at last, with assured purpose, Kitty seated
herself to write a letter. A difficult work it was to
pen it, good and loving soul, thou wilt not doubt it.
No attempt at disguise was made in the writing, yet
she left the letter without signature, thinking to herself
he will understand how it all is; he will, if there
is any honor in him, explain—at least he shall feel
that there is one here who watches him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Lind</span>,—Because you seem blind, and deaf,
and dumb, to all that you should, as a man of honor,
be proud to see and know, I deem myself excusable
in reminding you of what you owe to one who has
received you into her presence as a brother, as <span class='it'>more</span>.
I have no feeling of false delicacy in thus appealing
to you. A sense of right you must have. You will
<span class='it'>feel</span> that I am only true to myself, to my sense of
right, in so doing. Halting thus, when you have
gone so far, you do that which no gentleman <span class='it'>should</span>
do. I cannot yet believe that you have sought the
presence of one who loves you well, if not wisely,
merely because it afforded you a momentary pleasure.
Let me remind you that the life-peace of a human
being depends upon the course you shall pursue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This heroic epistle was, of course, written, destroyed,
and rewritten many times before Kitty became
fully satisfied that it was to her purpose. That
very night it was despatched to the post with no
feelings of false delicacy, as she said, but with a
very little trepidation. Dear child! she must certainly
have been laboring under a species of moral
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
insanity, when she thought it better to risk so much
as she did, rather than a whole life should be made
miserable by her hesitation, as she believed Lucy
Freer’s would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day, Saturday, happened to be consecrated
to the memory of St. Valentine, February
the fourteenth. Much relieved in mind, Kitty sat
on this “All Fool’s Day,” with the governess in her
boudoir—a very charming place it was, by the way,
where beauty lived with the heiress. They were
listlessly looking over the love declarations which
filled the silver waiter before them; and it was evident
that the passionate confessions on which they
gazed, produced little effect, save a vague, momentary
curiosity in the minds of either. One of them, in
her young heart, had renounced all loves, and as for
the other—</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at last Lucy looked upon her pupil with a
flushed, smiling face, exclaiming, “Here is a missive
for <span class='it'>you</span> from Eugene! You know the writing—isn’t
it his? It will be worth reading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!” was the doubtful, brief reply—and Kitty
held out her hand quite carelessly for the Valentine,
though, try as she might, she could not conceal the
sudden flashing of her eyes, and her hand, I believe,
trembled a little. She took the note and read—to
<span class='it'>herself</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden smile, brilliant in its gladness, swept over
the maiden’s face as she read; but then remembering
somewhat, she arose, and hastily flung the perfumed
note within the grate, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The impudence of those village boys is unpardonable;
neither of us know them much more than
by sight, and they have no right to presume so far!”
But though she spoke so pettishly, Kitty’s smile, as
she read the quoted love-lay, had not escaped Lucy’s
notice, and she said quietly in reply,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, Eugene Lind is not a <span class='it'>boy</span>, and I don’t
think his writing to you <span class='it'>this</span> day a piece of presumption
either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At night-fall, when Kitty sat alone, another epistle
was laid before her, which she read from beginning
to end in such a state of bewilderment as may be
“imagined but not described.”</p>

<hr class='tbk123'/>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Friend</span>,—I have this morning received a
letter, singular rather in its bearings—at least to the
fashion-moulded automaton it might seem so—to me
it is blessed to appear any thing <span class='it'>but</span> blessed. A letter
written in such a style of undisguised earnestness
and truth, that, though it is Valentine day, I cannot
doubt (perhaps you will say it is because I <span class='it'>will</span> not)
either the writer’s name, or the purport of her words—a
declaration of love! And to me it is unspeakably
dearer than any thing else in the wide world could
be. It is only because I felt sensible every day of
an increasing, engrossing interest in her, that I have
stayed so long away—it seems an age to me—from
Woodland Cottage. Now, if it be indeed true that I
<span class='it'>have</span> gained the affection of your glorious young
charge, am I not blest? Of such ‘a consummation,
most devoutly to be wished,’ I have dreamed, but
never dared really to hope. To-morrow I shall come
to you, Lucy, and you must counsel me. The letter
inclosed has just reached me, accompanying one for
myself from Richmond. Joy to you! for now can
you ‘give care to the winds’ once more—a bright
day is dawning, I clearly foresee it.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:7em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Adieu, yours ever,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Eugene Lind</span>.”</p>

<hr class='tbk124'/>

<p class='pindent'>Was there ever—was there <span class='it'>ever</span> such a mishap?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely never did astonished, troubled mortal wish
more fervently for instant annihilation than did poor
Kitty Clover as she read this letter, discovering at
its conclusion that it had been by mistake addressed
to <span class='it'>her</span>! With what frantic haste did she commit it
to the flames—how furiously the bell-rope swung in
her hand—how passionately she dispatched the servant
who answered her call with the letter which
had come inclosed, to Lucy. And then, the windy
tempest having passed, how wildly did she weep, as
she barred herself from human sight, that she might
agonize alone over the effect of her most stupid interference!
Dead within her was all curiosity; she
cared not who the stranger Richmond was; she cared
not for the conviction that Eugene Lind was at that
moment rejoicing in the thought of having won her
love; the natural misconstruction he had been so
glad to put upon her words, took in her mind nothing
like the shape of a “comedy of errors”—it was
something intolerably worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For hours she wept wildly and without ceasing;
but the fountain of tears was at last exhausted, and
near midnight, having become wonderfully calm
again—the calmness of desperation it was, doubtless,
and thinking of every thing but sleep—Kitty ventured
into the presence of her governess. Neither
had Lucy yet retired; but there she sat, <a id='pori'></a>poring over
her letter, and looking more beautiful and happy
than she had in many weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kitty seated herself at Lucy’s feet, and said, quite
regardless of her friend’s astonishment at the ghost-like
appearance she made,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anybody you love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, if there were <span class='it'>not</span> I should die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
“<span class='it'>Whom</span> do you love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, dear Kitty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, is there anybody you shall <span class='it'>marry</span>? Do you
like any person well enough for that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I truly hope it. ’Twould be forlorn to think
otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, in Heaven’s name, don’t trifle! Tell me
something about yourself, about your past life; if
you do not, Lucy, I shall go mad at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy seemed lost in wonder, or in retrospection,
as Kitty spoke thus; she did not answer, and the impatient
child, unable to bear the silence and suspense,
threw herself on her knees, and looked up imploringly,
with clasped hands, on the governess; finally,
she said, “Lucy Freer, tell me—<span class='it'>do</span> you love Eugene?
What has made you so sad and pale lately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I love <span class='it'>him</span>! Yes, heartily—he has been so
kind to me!” was the now immediate and energetic
reply. “Would you hear of my past, dear Kitty?
It is a dreary story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was now the young girl who was silent;
with her head bent to her knees she sat at the feet
of the governess; perhaps Lucy comprehended her
thoughts by intuition, (I know not,) but at all events
she did not wait long for a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a married woman already,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now was Kitty all life and fire—up she sprung,
exclaiming,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is <span class='it'>he</span>, then, your husband?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, far from it,” was the answer which rolled
back a cloud that threatened to make more than
Hadé’s gloom in the soul of the pupil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will tell you all, dear child; indeed, I will, for
I can <span class='it'>now</span>—sit down.” She was obeyed. “To-night
Eugene Lind, God bless him! has sent me a
letter, the first received in months from my husband,
Richmond Freer. Come nearer, Kitty, look
up, I am sad no longer, even though I tell you he is
exiled, he can never come back to old England again.
But I am going to him. I am going very soon.”
No, even at this sudden and most unexpected announcement,
the listener would not lift her head.
“When I was at school, in London, I wrote occasionally
for a paper which Richmond edited; and
by so doing I was able to help my poor, dear mother
very much—and she was in need of help. After
a while I became personally acquainted with the
editor, and when at last he was arrested for publishing
what was called an incendiary—a too patriotic
a paper for these slavish times—you may be sure
I did not forget to feel for him. After his trial was
over, and the sentence of banishment was passed
on him, we met again, for we loved each other,
Kitty, and misfortune made him only dearer to me.
The very night of his departure from England, his
cousin, Eugene Lind, married us—and my poor
mother was present at the ceremony; she would not
oppose the union, wild as it doubtless seemed to her,
because she knew that we were not fickle in our love,
and felt that a bright time might at last come even
to us. Shortly after the exile’s departure she died.
I was left <span class='it'>alone</span>! When I had finished the course
of studies, and was a graduate, owing to Eugene’s
efforts, this situation of governess in your home was
secured to me. May Heaven bless and make all
your life happy, Kate; you have been kind and
dear to me. For a long time Richmond lived on the
Continent; but he did not prosper there—he has
been very unfortunate, poor fellow! Now that he
has gone to the New World, a pilgrim shorn of all
things but my love, do you not see—I must go to
him? He calls me—I must go; and what a glorious
word is that <span class='it'>must</span>! Kitty, you will not ask me again
if I love Eugene Lind, or I shall launch out into such
praises of him as will astonish you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thinking now but of one thing, that Lucy <span class='it'>had</span>
certainly, in some unaccountable way, discovered
her secret, Kitty sprung from her humble posture,
she could not speak one word, but with a kiss she
left the governess alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And oh, what a miserable little puss was she that
live-long night. It was now all clear; she, the
proud, lofty-hearted, impulsive Kate, stood in the
eyes of another as having demanded his love—a
beggar, imploring his hand in payment of the heart
given him unasked. Hugh! what blackness of darkness
was that which enveloped her now, body and
spirit, as she sat through the night-hours pondering
with burning brain on her wretched mistake. How
hateful, how intrusive seemed the sunlight which
at last streamed in upon her! How would he ever
believe, how could he ever be told the ridiculous truth
of the matter? For the very tenor of that philanthropic
letter she had written, made it impossible for her to
find or even seek a confidante in Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was but one thought that could at all console
the mourner; perhaps Eugene Lind would seek
her hand some day, relying on the truth of what he
imagined her declaration, and then how disdainfully
she would spurn him—yes! if she died in the struggle,
she would renounce him! Dear spirit of human
pride, what a mighty thing thou art!</p>

<p class='pindent'>True to his expressed intention, Eugene visited
Woodland Cottage the next day, and everyday until
the departure of the governess; but Lucy and Mr.
Clover alone received him. It was said in the
house that Kitty, in her grief at parting with Lucy,
had wept herself sick; and for some cause or other
it was very evident that the gay girl was transformed
into a “weeping maiden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to Lucy’s mind it was all very clear; she had
read Kitty’s heroic appeal to Eugene, and could not
doubt that it had been made on her own account;
she had no occasion to seek her pupil’s confidence,
and when her <span class='it'>cousin</span>, in his trouble, revealed to her
all his doubt and grief, though she made no explanation,
she felt warranted in reassuring him, in
promising him an ultimate victory, if not an easy one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a relief to Kitty Clover when she was left
alone in the cottage; <span class='it'>alone</span>, I say, for her father accompanied
Lucy and Mr. Lind to the sea-side; the
sorrow at parting with her friend was soon overcome,
the tears wiped away, and she breathed freely
once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Eugene returned from Liverpool, as Lucy
had counseled him, he wrote to Kate a frank and
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
manly letter, which ended with these words, “You
have my life in your hands—to make it glad or miserable.
I love you, and can be happy only if you return
my love. May I come to you, and will you
welcome me? Oh remember, I pray you, how much
depends on your reply, and be merciful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the speedy answer was, only, “I do not love—I
cannot receive you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a smile of triumph this was written, reader;
and though a more thoroughly false declaration never
issued from the <span class='it'>will</span> of a proud woman, still, when
it was penned and sent, the more Kitty felt her respect
and power of self-endurance rising rapidly;
life seemed to her then, as, after all, a pleasant burden,
easy to be borne. Yes, she could live—live
happily, too, alone with her dear old sire, free in
heart and in fancy, fetterless as the winds—for the
shadow of a shade of control Mr. Clover never
thought of exercising over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But was she <span class='it'>really</span> happy? Why, then, was she
so tearful, so shy of cherishing old memories? And
if she was <span class='it'>not</span> fearful, how happened it that she so
carefully piled away her old music, every song,
every tune she had used in the by-gone? Why did
she hide from sight, in the high, remote shelves of
the library, all those books from which Eugene once
read to her and Lucy Freer? Why was the school-room,
that pleasant chamber, so studiously shunned?
<span class='it'>Why was it</span>, dear, wise reader?</p>

<p class='pindent'>During all the summer days the daughter spent
much time in company with her sire; and to please
her, the old man began to be quite literary in his
tastes; and with chess, and books, and gardening,
the time went swiftly on to both. But a change had
come over Kitty—and Mr. Clover had eyes to perceive
it; but he rather rejoiced in it, and became
more proud of her than ever. She was a child no
longer—nor a lively, joyous girl, but a quiet, thoughtful
woman, becoming every day more beautiful,
more studious, and womanly. The idea of going into
the gay world had once made her almost wild with
joy, but now the proposal which the father made,
that they should pass the ensuing season in the metropolis
with his relatives, was received with simple
quiescence, and the preparations for a long sojourn
from home made calmly and soberly. The brain of
the lovely heiress teemed with no brilliant anticipations
of conquest; and love and show—what could it
mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sickness which, for the first time in her life,
prostrated Kitty, the very week previous to the intended
departure, was not therefore attributable to
great excitement, or to any like cause. It was a
slow, nervous fever, which, by degrees, wasted her
strength away, and left her an infant in helplessness
on her bed. The course of the disease could not be
checked; it brought her to the very door of death,
and there the angel stood, ready to break the slender
thread of life, yet the destroying work, as if in mercy
to the father, was delayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much of the time of this sickness her mind had
wandered sadly; and he who watched incessantly
beside the girl, the adoring old man, had become
cognizant of a secret which he was not too proud to
use. And so, one evening, just at twilight, he stood
with another—not the nurse, nor the physician—in
the sick chamber. Kitty had seemed sinking all the
day, and at nightfall the doctor had left her for a moment,
almost at his (professional) wit’s end. Then
it was that Mr. Clover also had gone forth, and when
he came again, Eugene Lind was with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sleeping when they entered, and both of
those strong men trembled when they stood together,
looking silently upon her wasted, pallid face. Eugene
sat down beside her, and when she awakened, reader,
the father went softly from the room.</p>

<hr class='tbk125'/>

<p class='pindent'>Hush! I cannot tell you of that awaking from death
to life—from the assumed indifference which had
nearly chilled a young heart out of existence, to the
life of love. No! and I <span class='it'>will</span> not tell it; but don’t
you say it is because I am tired of talking that I pause,
or that I feel inefficient to tell it all. It is not true.</p>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<p class='pindent'>But, still later in the season, when the brown
leaves were falling in every direction from the trees,
when the clouds gathered often in the sky, and the
frequent rains presaged cold winter storms, there
stood, one of those intensely bright days yet vouchsafed
October, a little lady, frail and young, leaning
on the arm of a gentleman, in the beech grove, near
Woodland Cottage. Cheerily fell the sunlight through
the almost leafless branches, and numberless insects
flitted to and fro—one of these, a tiny thing, alighted
on the maiden’s hand, <span class='it'>not</span> the one clasped in <span class='it'>his</span>!
They had paused in their walk to rest, and neither had
for many moments spoken; but as they began, as by
mutual consent, to retrace their steps, the gentleman
looked up into the blue sky, exclaiming fervently,
“How <span class='it'>beautiful</span> it is to-day!” and with a heart
full of thankfulness, he murmured fondly a name—a
name with which the reader is familiar. Then
he looked upon <span class='it'>her</span>, and he seemed to find all of
heaven reflected in her eyes—and more beautiful
than the sky or the sunshine seemed she to him; he
bent his stately form, he kissed her; and, reader,
her arms wound round him in a moment, she returned
his embracing. It was a marriage-covenant—nothing
more or less!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ha! then the insect flitted away, far, far up above
the happy mortals, with a cry heard never before,
and the grove became vocal with it; how crimson
grew the girl’s pale face, as she heard that strange,
bold voice, proclaiming to the winds, “<span class='it'>Katy did!</span>”</p>

<hr class='tbk127'/>

<p class='pindent'>Over the ocean flew a message—thus it run:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is mine, Lucy! this brave, proud, generous
little Kitty, is mine! And because she is given to
me in this eleventh hour, I feel that she is a ‘gift of
God,’—a gift unspeakably precious. My heart is
<span class='it'>full</span> of ‘thanksgiving and the voice of melody,’ for
we are one now—one forever—in life and in death,
one. I shudder when I think how she has twice
been nearly lost to me—once by her own lofty pride,
and again by the Angel of Death, who seemed a
terror-king when he hovered beside her. She is so
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
pale and weak, so unlike her former self in physical
beauty, that I tremble when I look upon her; yet I
know, Lucy, that she will not die. We shall both
live, to prove, on earth, how strong a tie of love
unites us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, they did live to prove it; and certainly a
happier poet never breathed, than he whose bright
and cheering songs, springing from a deep, clear
fountain in the heart, went afterward, floating over
the wide earth—they were the most glorious “songs
of the affections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so you have the long and the short of the
matter. You know as well as I, all that poor Katy
did! How many times on this great earth have
“trifles, light as air,” set all the world a-gadding!
Alas! yes, creatures as brainless and chattering, and
far less innocent, than the insect disputants, have we
humans too often proved ourselves. Many a great
matter has a spark of fire kindled; and the “Comedy”
has become a rare thing in comparison with the
Tragedy of Errors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the general, and very incorrect appellation of
Bay Snipe, and sometimes of Plover, the sea-shore gunners,
and city fowlers who accompany them for pleasure,
are wont to include many totally distinct and different
families of waders, each containing several varieties, and
all, though in some sort connected, entirely dissimilar in
characteristics, plumage, cry and flight, as well as in
some peculiarities of habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of these families, the most remarkable are the Curlew,
<span class='it'>numenius</span>; the Godwit, <span class='it'>limosa</span>; the Sandpiper, <span class='it'>tringa</span>;
the Tattler, <span class='it'>totanus</span>; the Plover, <span class='it'>charadrius</span>; the Snipe,
<span class='it'>scolopax</span>; the Turnstone, <span class='it'>strepsilas</span>; the Sanderling, <span class='it'>calidris</span>;
the Avoset, <a id='recu'></a><span class='it'>recurvirostra</span>; and the Stilt, <span class='it'>himantopus</span>;
all of which at some period of the year are visiters
or temporary inhabitants of some portion of the Atlantic
shores of North America, from the Bay of Boston to the
Belize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the tepid waters of Florida, the great bay of Mobile,
the sea lakes of Borgne and Pontchartrain, and all along
the muddy shoals and alluvial flats of the lower Mississippi,
these aquatic races dwell in myriads during the
winter months, when the ice is thick even in the sea bays
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
of the Delaware and Chesapeake, and when all the gushing
streams and vocal rivulets of the Northern and Middle
States, are bound in frozen silence. In the spring,
according to the temperature of the season, from the middle
of April until the end of May, these migratory tribes
begin to visit us of the northern shores, from the Capes
of the Chesapeake, along all the river estuaries, sea bars,
lagoons, and land-locked bays, as they are incorrectly
termed, of Maryland and Delaware, the Jersey shores
and the Long Island waters, so far as to Boston Bay, beyond
which the iron-bound and rugged nature of the coast
deters them from adventuring, in the great flights with
which they infest our more succulent alluvial shores and
sea marshes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the end of May, with the exception only of a few
loitering stragglers, wounded, perhaps, or wing-worn,
which linger after the departure of their brethren, they
have all departed, steering their way, unseen, at immense
altitudes, through the trackless air, across the mighty
continent, across the vast lakes of the north, across the
unreclaimed and almost unknown hunting-grounds of the
red man, to those remote and nearly inaccessible morasses
of the Arctic Regions whither the foot of man has rarely
penetrated, and where the silence of ages is interrupted
only by the roll of the ocean surf, the thunderous crash of
some falling iceberg, and the continuous clangor of the
myriads and millions of aquatic fowl, which pass the period
of reproduction in those lone and gloomy, but to
them secure and delightful asylums. Early in the autumn,
or, to speak more correctly, in the latter days of summer,
the Bay birds begin to return in hordes innumerable, recruited
by the young of the season, which, not having as
yet indued the full plumage of their respective tribes, are
often mistaken by sportsmen and gunners, unacquainted
with the distinctions of natural history, for new species.
During the autumn, they are much more settled and less
restless in their habits than during the spring visit, when
they are impelled northward by the irresistible <span class='it'>æstrum</span>,
which at that period stimulates all the migratory birds,
even those reared in confinement and caged from the nest,
to get under way and travel, whither their wondrous instinct
orders them, in order to the reproduction of their
kind in the localities most genial and secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the months of August and September, they
literally swarm on all our sand-bars, salt meadows, and
wild sea marshes, feeding on the beaches and about
the shallow pools left by the retiring tide, on the marine
animalculæ, worms, aquatic insects, small crabs, minute
shell-fish, and fry; after this time, commencing from the
beginning of October, they move southward for winter
quarters, although some species tarry later than others,
and some loitering individuals of all the species linger
behind, until they have assumed their winter garniture,
when they are again liable to be mistaken for unknown
varieties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of these misnamed Bay Snipe, the following are the
species of each family most prized by the sportsman and
the epicure, all of which are eagerly pursued by the gunner,
finding a ready sale at all times, although, <span class='it'>me judice</span>,
their flesh is for the most part so oily, rank and sedgy,
that they are rather nauseous than delicate or palatable.
Much, however, depends on the state of their condition,
the nature of the food on which they have fattened, and
localities in which they feed; and to some persons the
very flavor, of which I complain as rank, sedgy and fishy,
appears to take the guise of an agreeable <span class='it'>haut gout</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red-breasted Sandpiper, <span class='it'>Tringa Icelandica</span>, known
on the Long Island waters, among the small islets of
which it is very abundant, as the “Robin Snipe,” by
which name it is generally called, owing to the resemblance
of its lower plumage to that of the Red-breasted
Thrush, or Robin, <span class='it'>Turdus migratorius</span>, of this continent.
In autumn this bird assumes a dusky gray upper, and
white under, plumage, and is then termed the “White
Robin Snipe.” In point of flesh it is one of the best of
the Shore-birds. It is easily called down to the decoys
by a well simulated whistle, and is consequently killed
in great numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Red-backed Sandpiper, <span class='it'>Tringa Alpina</span>, generally
known as the “Black-breasted Plover.” It is a restless,
active and nimble bird, flies in dense bodies, whirling at
a given signal; and at such times a single shot will frequently
bring down many birds. In October it is usually
very fat, and is considered excellent eating. In its
autumnal plumage it is generally known to fowlers as
the “Winter Snipe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pectoral Sandpiper, <span class='it'>Tringa pectoralis</span>. This is a
much smaller, but really delicious species, particularly
when killed on the upland meadows, which it frequents
late in the spring and early in the summer, and on which
I have killed it lying well to the dog, which will point it,
while spring snipe shooting. On Long Island it is known
as the “Meadow Snipe,” or “Short Neck;” on the Jersey
shores, about Egg Harbor, where it sometimes lingers
until the early part of November, it is called the “Fat
Bird,” a title which it well merits; and in Pennsylvania,
where it occurs frequently, is often termed the “Jack
Snipe.” It is these blunders in nomenclature, and multiplication
of local misnomers, which render all distinctions
of sportsmanship so almost incomprehensible to the
inhabitants of distant districts, and so perplexing to the
youthful naturalist. During the autumn of 1849 I killed
the Pectoral Sandpiper in great numbers, together with
the American Golden Plover, <span class='it'>Charadrius Marmoratus</span>,
and the Black-bellied Plover, <span class='it'>Charadrius Helveticus</span>, on
the marshes of the <span class='it'>Aux Canards</span> river, near Amherstberg,
in Canada West, in the month of September, and a month
later at Montgomery’s Pool, between lakes Simcoe and
Huron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Tattlers, three only are in repute as shore-birds,
the best of the species, the Bartramian Tattler, <span class='it'>Totanus
Bartramius</span>, better known as the “Upland Plover,”
which is, in fact, with scarcely an exception, the most
delicious of all our game-birds, being a purely upland and
inland variety, and as such never, or but extremely seldom,
shot on the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These three are,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Yellow-shanks Tattler, <span class='it'>Totanus Flavipes</span>, vulgo,
“the lesser yellow legs”—a bird, in my opinion, of very
indifferent qualifications for the table, but easily decoyed,
and readily answering the fowler’s whistle, and therefore
affording considerable sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Telltale Tattler, <span class='it'>Totanus Vociferus</span>, vulgo, “greater
yellow legs,” a less numerous species than the former,
and more suspicious. Its flesh, when it feeds on the
spawn of the king-crab, or “Horse-shoe,” is all but uneatable,
but later in the season it is in better condition,
and is esteemed good eating. A few are said to breed in
New Jersey. In the neighborhood of Philadelphia, where
these birds are shot in great numbers on the mud-flats of
the Delaware from skiffs, with carefully concealed gunners,
stealthily paddled down upon them till within close
shooting distances, these birds are termed “Plovers,”
and the pursuit of them plover shooting; of course wrongfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of this family is the Semipalmated Tattler,
<span class='it'>Totanus Semipalmatus</span>, universally known as the “Willet,”
from its harsh and shrill cry, constantly repeated
during the breeding season, the last note of which is
thought to bear some resemblance to that sound. It is a
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
swift, rapid and easy flyer, and though rather shy when
in exposed situations, can be allured to the decoys. When
in good order the flesh of the Willet is very palatable,
although not so greatly esteemed as its eggs, which really
are delicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to these come the Godwits, two in number, known
by the unmeaning title of Marlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great Marbled Godwit, <span class='it'>Limosa Fedoa</span>, the “Marlin.”
This bird, though not very abundant, is a regular
visitant of the seashores and bays in the spring and
autumn. It is very watchful, and will permit of no near
approach, unless some of its fellows are killed or wounded,
when it will hover over the cripples, with loud, shrill
cries, affording an easy opportunity of getting several barrels
in succession into the flock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the Hudsonian Godwit, <span class='it'>Limosa Hudsonica</span>, or the
“Ring-tailed Marlin,” is a still rarer and smaller variety
than the last, of very similar habits and of equal excellence
in flesh. It is far more common in the Middle
States than in the Eastern districts, and is abundant in
the wild and barren lands far to the northward. I have
seen it shot, likewise, on the swamps of the <span class='it'>Aux Canards</span>,
to which I have already referred. This is the larger of
the three birds, lying uppermost, in the group, at the head
of this article; it was sketched from a fine specimen shot
on the Delaware in the month of May. It is thus described
by Giraud in his excellent work on the Birds of
Long Island:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bill, blackish-brown, at base of lower mandible yellow;
upper parts light-brown, marked with dull-brown,
and a few small, white spots; neck all round brownish-gray;
lower parts white, largely marked with ferruginous;
basal part of tail-feathers and a band crossing the rump,
white. Adult with the bill slender, blackish-brown toward
the tip, lighter at the base, particularly at the base
of the lower mandible; a line of brownish-white from the
bill to the eye; lower eyelid white. Throat white, spotted
with rust color; head and neck brownish-gray; lower
parts white, marked with large spots of ferruginous;
under tail coverts barred with brownish-black and ferruginous;
tail brownish-black cast, a white band at the base;
a band over the rump; tips of primary coverts and basis of
quills white; upper tail-coverts brownish-black, their
basis white; upper parts grayish-brown, scapulars marked
with darker spots; feet bluish. Length fifteen inches and
a half, wing eight and a half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the various families of birds, which are all
known, as I have stated, by the general title of Bay Snipe,
there is but one Snipe proper, and that is one of the most
numerous, and perhaps the most excellent of the tribes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Redbreasted Snipe, <span class='it'>Scolapax Noveboracensis</span>—the
“Dowitcher,” the “Quail Snipe,” the “Brown Back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brace of these excellent and beautiful birds are depicted
as thrown carelessly on the ground, under the neck
of the Ring-tailed Marlin, in the preceding sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bird has the bill of the true snipe, <span class='it'>Scolopax Americanus</span>,
excepting only that the knob at the tip of the
upper mandible of the bill is less distinctly marked. The
spring plumage of this bird, in which it is depicted above,
is on the upper parts brownish-black, variegated with
clove-brown, and light reddish-brown, the secondaries
and wing-coverts tipped and edged with white. Lower
parts bright orange colored ferruginous, spotted with
dusky, arrow-headed spots. The abdomen paler. The
tail-feathers and upper tail-coverts alternately barred with
black and white; the legs and feet dull yellowish-green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the close of April,” says Mr. Giraud, “the Redbreasted
Snipe arrive on the coasts of Long Island. Invited
by a bountiful supply of food, at the reflux of the
tide, it resorts to the mud-flats and shoals to partake of
the rich supply of shell-fish and insects which nature in
her plenitude has provided for it. As the tide advances,
it retires to the bog meadows, where it is seen probing
the soft ground for worms. In the spring it remains with
us but a short time. Soon after recruiting it obeys the unerring
call of nature, and steers for the north, where it
passes the season of reproduction. About the middle of
July it returns with its young, and continues its visit
during September, and if the season be open, lingers
about its favorite feeding grounds until the last of the
month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The specimens from which the above sketch is taken,
were procured on the Delaware so late as the latter part
of May; but it must be remembered that this spring, 1850,
was unusually late and backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This snipe associates in large flocks, is very easily
whistled, flies in dense and compact bodies over the decoys,
and is so gentle that, after half the flock has been
cut down by the volleys of the lurking gunner, the remainder
will frequently alight, and walk about demurely
among their dead companions and the illusive decoys, until
the pieces are reloaded, and the survivors decimated by a
fresh discharge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even when feeding on the open mud-flats, the Redbreasted
Snipe is so tame as to allow itself to be approached
by the sportsman, with little or no address, running
about and feeding perfectly unsuspicious, until its
enemy has come within short range, when it springs with
its tremulous cry only to be riddled with the shot of the
close discharge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other of these birds worthy of the most attention
are,</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sanderling, <span class='it'>Calidris Arenaria</span>, which, though very
small, is fat and excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Black-bellied Plover, <span class='it'>Charadrius Helveticus</span>,
“Bull-headed,” or “Beetle-headed Plover,” a shy bird,
but frequently whistled within gunshot. On the coast it
is apt to be fishy, but when shot inland, and on upland
pastures, of superior quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American Golden Plover, <span class='it'>Charadrius Marmoratus</span>,
“the Frost bird;” a very beautiful species, and of rare
excellence when killed on the upland, where it is found
more frequently and more abundantly than on the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Long-billed Curlew, <span class='it'>numenius Longirostris</span>,
“Sickle-bill,” a large, coarse-flavored bird, easily decoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hudsonian Curlew, <span class='it'>numenius Hudsonicus</span>, “Short-billed
Curlew,” or “Jack Curlew.” Similar to the latter
in all respects, although smaller in size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And last, The Esquimaux Curlew, <span class='it'>numenius Borealis</span>,
“the Futes,” “the Doe Bird.” This bird feeds principally
on the uplands, in company with the golden plovers,
and on the same food, <span class='it'>videlicet</span>, grasshoppers, insects,
seeds, worms, and berries. Its flesh is delicate and high
flavored. It breeds far to the north, and winters far to the
south of the United States, residing with us from early in
August until late in November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this bird, although there are numerous other
smaller species, the list of these tribes may be held
complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the commencement of the present month until late
in the autumn, anywhere along the coasts and bays of the
Northern and Middle States a bag may readily be filled to
overflowing with these varieties by the aid of good decoys
and skillful whistling, or of a skiff paddled by a cunning
fowler; a gun of 8 to 10 pounds weight, of 12 <a id='gaug'></a>gauge, with
two oz. of No. 5 shot, and an equal measure of powder,
will do the work. But when the work is done, comparatively
the game is worthless, and the sport, as compared
with upland shooting, scarcely worth the having.</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Comes like sweet and lowly humming,</p>
<p class='line'>As if water-sprites were chanting, with a low and dreamy sound.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;If the sun have just arisen,</p>

<p class='line'>Clustered leaves, and vines, and flowers—and the dew-drops on the lawn—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;What a glory is before me—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;All around, beside, and o’er me—</p>
<p class='line'>What a glory, all of colors that no human hand hath drawn!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Or if it be at even,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When soft breezes blow from heaven,</p>
<p class='line'>And the glimmer of the twilight comes a-dancing through the leaves—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Oh! how thick my brain is crowded</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With sweet images enshrouded—</p>
<p class='line'>With sweet images enshrouded in the mists my fancy weaves!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Little pools lie closely hidden</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the woods, as if forbidden</p>
<p class='line'>To reflect within their surface but a hand’s breadth of the sky—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where the turtle’s lonely whirring</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Is at evening ever stirring,</p>
<p class='line'>Winning over the calm list’ner with its saddest melody.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I have often sat, when saddened,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And as often, too, when gladdened,</p>
<p class='line'>At the side of these clear mirrors, where the sweetest dreams have slept;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the world beyond forgotten,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Quiet thoughts would be begotten—</p>
<p class='line'>Thoughts of Life, and Love, and Heaven, over which I fondly wept.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And beside the river’s dashing,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the tumult of its plashing,</p>
<p class='line'>I have felt my pulses quickened, and my spirits bravely stirred;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Then below, where it runs slowly,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the boughs bend over lowly,</p>
<p class='line'>My soul again was saddened, as by some enchanter’s word.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Upon every tree are builded—</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;By the garish sun ne’er gilded—</p>
<p class='line'>Nests of songsters, close secluded in the still and welcome shades;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And within their snug dominions</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I can see the fledging pinions</p>
<p class='line'>Of the callow young, grown restless in their leafy colonnades.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The fresh morning air is ringing</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With a concord of sweet singing,</p>
<p class='line'>From a million throats all pouring out their melody of praise;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;High within the sylvan arches</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Of the chestnuts, holms, and larches,</p>
<p class='line'>Sounds the hymning of these songsters in the forest’s darkened maze.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I love to sit at morning,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In the glory of the dawning</p>
<p class='line'>Of the sunlight, flashing over the high eastern hills afar,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;On this broad piazza olden,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Where the gray streaks and the golden</p>
<p class='line'>Come a-streaming from their chambers through the vines that curtains are.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The hawthorn and the holly,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Bearing berries red and jolly,</p>
<p class='line'>Are inwoven with the bushes that run riot with them all;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And like caps of grenadiers</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The dark moss in clumps appears—</p>
<p class='line'>The dark moss that stands in bunches all along the garden wall.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;O, ’tis glorious in October,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;When the sky is clear and sober,</p>
<p class='line'>To rove among the beauties that abound at Riverside!</p>

<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With the Autumn colors, raising</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;And the influences setting</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Opera.</span>—Strange, that Philadelphia, with so much
musical taste and cultivation, cannot have an Opera.
Once in a while an Operatic troupe wanders along, and
rests, for a short time, in our sober town, gives a few
representations, then away it goes. Our neighbors of
New York manage this thing better—an Opera they will
have, even if they run in debt for it. And yet it seems
that one, properly managed, might succeed in this concert-loving
town of Penn. It must be a moderate one,
however; that is, moderate in price. A serious old merchant,
well to do in the world, will hesitate at taking even
two tickets, at a dollar a-piece, but he would not mind
taking a half dozen tickets if they cost only half that sum.
The principle is the thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brother Jonathan likes a show of economy, at least.
Every politician in Congress, who wishes to be popular
in Bunkum, invariably makes speeches against appropriations,
mileage, &amp;c., in order to prove that he is anxious to
save Uncle Sam’s purse; but, at the same time, this same
politician will have his pet appropriations, and not refuse
his mileage either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The small circle of fashionable people may subscribe
and talk, but they can do little in this opera matter, without
the support of the plain, unpretending portion of the
inhabitants, who, after all, make up the audience, and
bring in the money; and they have made up their minds to
give only a moderate sum, and they will not give any
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Troupe must be a good one; or, if only a slender
one, it must not attempt too much. The Seguins always
drew well, because they only attempted <span class='it'>Operettes</span>
and <span class='it'>Vaudevilles</span>. Not that the Philadelphians do not like
a higher order of music, but they are fastidious, and know
when a good Opera is badly given. They will not go to
hear the rich, full music of Norma murdered by a poor
Troupe, with worn-out voices, and meagre choruses.
Whatever they listen to must be well sung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We wish that inimitable knight of the Baton—the white
cravated Max Maretzek—would think a little of this. But
if he does, there is one hint that it would be well to whisper
in his ear, or in the ear of any other venturesome
Opera proprietor, who is bold enough to undertake the
establishing of an Opera here. There must be no cliques—no
<span class='it'>donnas</span> of different schools in the Troupe. We can
all remember how weary we all were of the Biscaccianti
and Truffi feud; and then, again, of the Truffi and Laborde
cliques. The real lovers of music, who went for
the love of the Opera, and not in a spirit of pedantic fashionable
affectation, were ready to exclaim, with Mercutio,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>A plague o’ both your houses.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Let the Opera be of either the French or Italian School,
so that it be of one, alone. There is sufficient love for
music with us, to make us liberal to either school, so that
it be well represented. So far as our own taste is concerned,
the Italian school is the more pleasing. The
French <span class='it'>vocalization</span> is too exaggerated, we think. It is
a mere matter of taste, however, and we will be content
to listen to either, so that we have an Opera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early part of the summer of ’47, an Italian Opera
Troupe, from Havana, tarried a few weeks in Philadelphia.
Most of the townsfolk, especially the wealthier
class, had left the town, and were at different watering
places; and, yet, we remember this company drew good
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of the best Troupes we have ever had in
Philadelphia. Its Donnas were Tedesco and Caranti Vita,
and Marini. Tedesco, with her rich, mellow, mezzo-soprano
voice, and the timid <span class='it'>petite</span> Vita, with a delicate
<span class='it'>sympathetic</span> soprano, that warbled like a bird—it was a
treat indeed. Then Marini—the only true Contr’alto we
ever heard—how she startled the audience with her fulness
and depth of tone. She was awkward as an actress,
and her voice, though rich, was rough; but there was so
much melody in it that it touched us, and we could not, if
we would, criticise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Operas sung by this Troupe we speak of, Saffo
and Sonnambula were our favorites. True, the Choruses
in Norma were beautifully done—for the Choruses of this
well-balanced Troupe were full, and well trained—but
the chaste, simple music of Saffo, suited Tedesco’s fresh,
young voice; and the delicate, melodious caroling of
Amina, was the very character of Caranti Vita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perelli—the popular Perelli, without whose instructions
no lady in Philadelphia, with any pretensions to a voice,
can possibly get along—was the Tenore in this Troupe,
and its Maestro. In Verdi’s Hernani, his voice produced
a fine effect and, every thing he sung, gave evidence of
high culture and good taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Opera of Saffo pleased us, particularly—the music
was so pure and chaste. Such compositions are the sculpture
of Music; a simple, classic plot—clear, decided harmony—pure
melody. This is enough—scenic illusions
and orchestral effects are of secondary importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This style of music belongs to a good, old school—the
story also is effective. Schlegel it is, we think, who says,
that there is a fanciful freedom in the handling of mythological
materials, or subjects taken from chivalrous or
pastoral romances, which always produces a fine effect in
Opera. That so soon as the Heroic Opera chains itself
down to History, after the manner of Tragedy, Dullness,
with a leaden sceptre, presides over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another Opera of this school, the music of which
we have heard, but we have never seen the opera represented—Niobe.
Every instrumental performer will recal,
with something like a loving memory, the beautiful melody
from this Opera, “<span class='it'>I tuoi frequenti palpiti</span>,” which has
been arranged, in “<span class='it'>all sorts of ways</span>,” for different instruments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good Reader, we will have a chat once in a while, on
this subject of Music. We will talk together of Concerts,
sometimes, both professional and amateur—and we will
give some good-natured hints to our amateur <span class='it'>prima donnas</span>,
about the difference between stage-singing and chamber
singing. But you must join with us in all we say, and
though we play spokesman and you listener, you must
agree with us, and while we talk, you stand behind us,
and make the gestures—then we shall succeed in interesting
others as well as ourselves.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Latter-Day Pamphlets. Edited by Thomas Carlyle. No. 6.
Parliaments. Boston: Phillips, Sampson &amp; Co.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We think that this pamphlet, though its notions are
pushed to a crazy extreme, is calculated to do good. In
attacking the existence of legislative assemblies, it lays
bare and mercilessly ridicules their abuses, especially
their tendency to endless and worthless talk and palaver.
The style is not that which Carlyle is accustomed to use
in his library, but the style of Carlyle over his brandy and
water; and it accordingly has the recklessness as well as
the fire of that peculiar method of accelerating the faculties.
The Parliament which Carlyle likes, and which he
contrasts with Lord John’s, is an old Norman one, before
the business of Parliament had been undertaken by the
newspapers; a Parliament which advised, not a Parliament
which governed. “Reading,” he says, “in Eadmerus
and the dim old Books, one finds gradually that the
Parliament was at first a most simple Assemblage, quite
cognate to the situation; that Red William, or whoever had
taken upon him the terrible task of being King of England,
was wont to invite, oftenest about Christmas time, his
subordinate Kinglets, Barons, as he called them, to give
him the pleasure of their company for a week or two;
there, in earnest conference all morning, in freer talk over
Christmas cheer all evening, in some big royal Hall of
Westminster, Winchester, or wherever it might be, with
log-fires, huge rounds of roast and boiled, not lacking
Malmsey and other generous liquor, they took counsel
concerning the arduous matters of the kingdom. ‘You,
Taillebois what have you to propose in this arduous
matter.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Tête-d’étoupes, speak out. And first the
pleasure of a glass of wine, my infant!’ Thus, for a fortnight’s
space, they carried on, after a human manner, their
grand National Consult, or <span class='it'>Parliamentum</span>; intermingling
Dinner with it (as is still the modern method;) debuting
every thing as Tacitus describes the Ancient Germans to
have done, two times; once sober, and once what he calls
‘drunk’—not exactly dead-drunk, but jolly round their big
table; that so both sides of the matter might be seen, and,
midway between rash hope and unreasonable apprehension,
the true decision of it might be hit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the pamphlet the author wantons in dogmatism
and impertinence, and has an especial love for a
phrase representing the British people as “twenty-seven
millions mostly fools.” The United States comes in as
usual for a rap. The rumor is, that we are indebted for
all Carlyle’s sarcasms against our people to the American
tourists who have bored him; persons whom he always
treated with roughness, but whom he now receives with
almost savage insolence. We have heard a story of an
American lady, who visited him—under the impression
that he was a great philanthropist, and immediately opened
the conversation with some remarks in favor of the abolition
of slavery. He growled out a bitter rejoinder, in
which he took strong grounds in favor of that institution,
and denounced all abolitionists as sentimental fools and
flunkies. The lady, irritated and surprised, hit instantly
on the true woman’s method, the <span class='it'>argumentum ad hominum</span>,
and put the startling question, “How, Mr. Carlyle,
should you like to be a slave?” He dilated his person to
its full dimensions, and in his broad Scotch brogue exclaimed,
“Well, I should be glad to be a great bull-necked
nigger, and have somebody to take care of me!” We
must confess to a sympathy with his wish, as far as it relates
to somebody’s taking care of him, we think good
might be done to his head in an asylum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, however, an allusion in the pamphlet to our
Congress, which is not without its wisdom just at this
time, and which may be safely commended to the attention
of those honorable members who consume time and
money, precious to the public, in speeches which rarely
rise in thought to the level of party newspaper leaders,
and which, in style, are often below the rhetoric of romances
in yellow covers. He says, “Only perhaps in the
United States, which alone of all countries can do without
governing—every man being at least able to live, and
move off into the wilderness, let Congress jargon as it will—can
such a form of so-called ‘Government’ continue for
any length of time to torment men with the semblance,
when the indispensable substance is not there. For
America, <span class='it'>as the citizens well know</span>, is an ‘unparalelled
country’—with mud soil enough, and fierce sun enough
in the Mississippi valley alone to grow Indian corn for the
extant Posterity of Adam at this time; what other country
ever stood in such a case? ‘Speeches to Bunkum,’ and
a constitutional battle of the Kilkenny cats, which in other
countries are becoming tragical and unendurable, may
there still fall under the comical category.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Webster’s Dictionary.</span>—A new quarto edition of Webster’s
Dictionary, with additions by Professor Goodrich,
has recently been issued by G. &amp; C. Merriam, of Springfield,
and is for sale in this city by booksellers generally.
Study of the Dictionary is the great want of a majority of
American writers. They neither drink at the sources
nor draw from the depths of the language, to supply the
thirst for purity, variety, and force of expression, with
which truly masculine minds are panting. With a vocabulary
equal to the largest demands of truth in its labors,
or of imagination in its play, we find constantly recurring
the same set-phrases, the same commonplaces, the same
worn-out figures. Our college-bred men are not deficient
in a Johnsonian stock of Latin derivatives, but into the
Saxon mine of our tongue, few of them have ever delved.
They are too indolent to open the record and search for
the treasures bequeathed to them. Until Webster’s researches
and toils brought these treasures together, they
were so far hidden and scattered, that few even of the
learned appreciated their amount. Thirty-five years he
spent in the compilation of his Dictionary; and since the
publication of the first edition, it has been enriched by
himself and the present editor with thousands of words;
and it is now, by the consent of the learned in England
as well as this country, valuable above every other, for
comprehensiveness, etymological accuracy, and clearness
of verbal definitions. The new quarto contains the whole
matter of the former editions in two volumes, printed with
clear type, on good paper, and substantially bound. It is
one of the few books, of which a threadbare recommendation
may be truly repeated—“no library is complete without
it.” One of the most distinguished of American
writers, whose choice of fresh and forceful words has at
times brought upon him a charge of pedantry, but who in
fact has only used fearlessly the wealth of the language,
told us, some years ago, that it was his habit to read the
Dictionary through about once every year. To the student,
this practice may be commended as of inestimable service.
A single word is often the cue to a sentiment or a train of
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
ideas worthy of expression. As the mind is full of words
to give variety to its pictures, so will it be full of suggestions
for new subjects. The relation between words
and ideas is to a degree an absolute identity. An illiterate
person sits down to write a letter. His fund of language
being small, the paucity of his thoughts is in the same
proportion. He may have traveled half over the world,
yet he has nothing to say to his friends at home, except
that he is well, and hopes they are the same. Our young
writers may find in this illustration a reason for studying
the Dictionary faithfully and continually. Not from the
conversation of the educated, or from miscellaneous books
alone, will they catch by accident the riches of the language.
They must search and reflect—a task which the
labors of Webster and his great predecessors in lexicography,
have reduced to child’s play. Among the two
or three thousand newspapers in the United States, are
at least some hundreds edited by men who have not had
the opportunities of a classical education. Minds only of
extraordinary energy, or those rising to the standard of
genius, can do perfect justice to the important duties of
journalism without the advantages of this discipline.
But they may in mature life, find its best substitute in the
systematic study of a comprehensive Dictionary, in connection
with the classics of the language. Were this
method adopted, we would not so often have reason to
blush for the feebleness and illiteracy exhibited not only
in many newspaper columns, but in the pages of periodicals
of far higher pretensions, as exemplars of rhetorical propriety.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Miscellaneous Works of Oliver Goldsmith. Including
a Variety of Pieces now first collected. By James Prior.
New York: George P. Putnam. 4 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Few English classics have been edited with the care
and the thoroughness of this edition of Goldsmith. Prior,
an antiquarian who never touches a subject which he does
not exhaust, has paid especial attention to Goldsmith; has
written a biography of him, which forms the basis both
of Foster’s and Irving’s; and in the present edition, has
printed many valuable essays and poems never before collected.
The articles contributed by Goldsmith to the
Monthly and Critical Reviews, when he was a hack-writer
in the most dismal sense of that term, are here collected;
and though not to be compared with his best works
for humor or for style, they still evince the hand of genius
in many a scrap of serene wisdom, and in many a sentence
of penetrating sagacity. In the fourth volume, just published,
we find an oratorio, “The Captivity,” and a ludicrous
scene from a farce called “The Grumbler,” never
before printed. Mr. Putnam has issued the edition in a
style of great neatness, and has placed it at a very low
price. We hope it will meet with a sale corresponding
to its merits. It supersedes all the other editions of Goldsmith
now in the market, being the best printed, and the
best edited of all, and containing several hundred pages
of matter to be found in no other collection.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Moneypenny, or the Heart of the World. A Romance of
the Present Day. By Cornelius Mathews. New York:
Dewitt &amp; Davenport. 1 vol. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mathews is well known as an able but somewhat
eccentric writer, with the grotesqueness, as well as the
insight of the humorist, and often miscalculating the avenues
to popular favor, while he gave no evidence of lacking
the powers which deserve it. His present novel is
his best production in respect to story and characterization,
and is especially remarkable for its minute knowledge of
every locality, and every phase of humanity and life, in
the city of New York. This is not displayed in the way
of a mere copyist, but in the higher mode of the observing
humorist, to whom external forms are symbolical of
serious or smiling spiritual facts. The style sparkles
with a kind of laughing earnestness, which indicates an
intense sympathy in the author with the varying throng
of local objects which press upon his imagination for representation.
We commend it to all readers who have
fancies to be touched by its quaint analogies, and risibilities
to be tingled by its humor.</p>

by the author. New York: Geo. P. Putnam.
2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The popularity of the author of these delightful volumes is
indicated by the rapid sale of the first edition, which was
disposed of on the day of publication. The work will add to
Taylor’s reputation in respect to every quality of mind and
disposition for which he is deservedly distinguished. It so
combines the observer with the poet, that the reader soon
becomes the author’s companion, seeing what he sees and
feeling what he feels. His descriptions of scenery are
beautiful representations; a few quiet and magical sentences
bring pictures right before the eye; and when his
subject happens to be the vegetation of the tropics, he
gives us not only foliage but fragrance. The whole book
is pervaded by that genial and happy spirit, which lends
fascination to all of Taylor’s writings, and converts his
readers into friendly partisans. We have not space at
present to indicate the stores of information and delight
which the volumes contain, but will extract one paragraph
on a Pacific sunset, as a specimen of the ease with which
the author’s facile style rises to eloquence. “Why,” he
exclaims, “has never a word been said or sung about sunset
on the Pacific? No where on this earth can one be
overvaulted with such a glory of colors. The sky, with
a ground-hue of rose toward the west, and purple toward
the east, is mottled and flecked over all its surface
with light clouds, running through every shade of crimson,
amber, violet, and russet-gold. There is no dead
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
duskiness opposite the sunken sun; the whole vast shell
of firmament glows with an equal radiance, reduplicating
its hues on the glassy sea, so that we seem floating
in a hollow sphere of prismatic crystal. The cloud-strata,
at different heights in the air, take different coloring;
through bars of burning carmine one may look on the soft,
rose-purple folds of an inner curtain, and, far within and
beyond that, on the clear amber-green of the immaculate
sky. As the light diminishes, these radiant vapors sink
and gather into flaming pyramids, between whose pinnacles
the serene depth of air is of that fathomless violet-green
which we see in the skies of Titian.”</p>

from the Persian. By Rev. James L. Merrick, Eleven
Years Missionary to the Persians. Boston: Phillips,
Sampson &amp; Co. 1 vol. 8vo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is altogether the most important and trust-worthy
work relating to Mohammed ever translated into English,
giving, as it does, “a full view of his life and religion, with
sketches of his ancestors, companions, and times, blended
with maxims and legends illustrative of Oriental manners.”
To the theologian it is invaluable, while to the
general reader it is as interesting as an Oriental romance,
being in the form of narrative, with frequent flashes of
magnificent poetry. The account of the birth of Mohammed,
especially, is exquisitely beautiful. As a specimen
of the style, we give a paragraph embodying Sawadbin-Karib’s
testimony. “Four days after the birth, Sawadbin-Karib,
a man celebrated among the Arabs for his
knowledge, came to congratulate Abdulmutalib, and see
the child of whom he had heard many marvelous accounts.
On going to the house of Aminah they were informed that
he was asleep. When the cover of the cradle was removed
to gratify them with a sight of the wonderful babe,
<span class='it'>such lightning gleamed from his blessed countenance that
the roof of the house was cloven by it, and the visiters drew

Edition, Enlarged. Boston: Crosby &amp; Nichols. 1 vol.
12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The title of this volume is an honest title, accurately
describing the contents. The poems are selected from a
wide variety of English authors, and consist of pieces
which have not been worn threadbare by previous publication
in school-reading books. Some of the selections will
be new to most readers of poetry, such as the narrative
poems of French and those of Mary Lamb. We notice
two poems by Tennyson not included in the edition of his
works. “The Skylark” is here, not only in Shelly’s rapturous
lyric, but as he was viewed by the imaginations of
Wordsworth and Hogg. Wordsworth’s wonderful “Ode
on the Intimations of Immortality from the Recollections
of Childhood,” the grandest and subtlest of modern odes,
is given in full. We notice also a number of pieces by
Vaughan, Quarles, and holy George Herbert, not generally
known. The Prioress’s Tale is reprinted in Chaucer’s
old spelling, its quaint phraseology truly embodying its intense
sweetness of sentiment. Altogether, we think that
“home” to be deficient in which this volume has not its
place.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This handsome volume is composed of letters, running
over a period of sixteen years, and recording impressions
of travel in Europe and America. The heart and imagination
of Bryant consecrate and color the whole series:
and though the scenes he describes have often been described
by others, they appear new and fresh as mirrored
in his pages. The serene but searching, the tolerant but
earnest, mind of the author, gives the same life and charm
to his prose as to his verse. The style is characterised by
the grace, delicacy and thoughtfulness, the sober beauty,
and “superb propriety,” native to his mind; and the cadence
of his sentences leaves a lingering music in the
reader’s brain, long after the book has been closed. The
scenes and incidents of the volume are of exceeding variety.
Paris, Florence, Pisa, Venice, London, <a id='edin'></a>Edinburgh,—Richmond,

Havana, Boston, Portland,—the <a id='peak'></a>Peaks of Derbyshire

<span class='it'>Essays Upon Authors and Books. By W. Alfred Jones.
New York: Stanford &amp; Swords. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The writer of this valuable little volume is favorably
known among all who favor independent thought, exercised
in the domain of literary criticism and characterization,
as the author of “The Analyst” and “Literary
Studies.” The “Essays” are thirty in number, covering
a wide variety of topics, and indicating that kind of literary
knowledge which looks through books into the spiritual
constitution of their authors. Mr. Jones is a professor of
the condensed in composition, and seems ever ambitious
to cram his matter into a small space, and short, sharp,
curt sentences. Perhaps he sacrifices mellowness in thus
aiming after the laconic, but his fault is of so rare a nature
in these days of verbose expansiveness, that to blame him
for it were to fall into a worse one. Among the many
essays which induce us heartily to recommend this volume
to the reader, are those entitled “Traits of American
Authorship,” “Home Criticism,” “The Two Everetts,”
“Hoyt’s Poems,” “Hugh Latimer,” “Sir Philip Sidney’s
Defense of Poesy,” “R. H. Dana,” “Burton’s Anatomy
of Melancholy,” “The Literature of Quakerism,” “Æsthetical
Fragments,” “Thomas Moore,” and “Lord
Bolingbroke.” Mr. Jones’s culture sweeps over the field
of English literature, and some of his most interesting
essays relate to quaint authors, whose names are in few
mouths, but who are capable, in capable hands, of being
made interesting even in this age. We need not say that
the moral character of Mr. Jones’s criticism is as high as
it’s mental, and that his book may be safely taken as a
guide to young as well as to experienced readers.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Hints Toward Reforms, in Lectures, Addresses and Other
Writings. By Horace Greely. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of this volume is well known as the editor
of an influential political journal, and as a sturdy, independent,
benevolent, strong-minded and warm-hearted reformer.
The topics he discusses are those which deeply
interest the popular mind at this time—labor, temperance,
land reform, capital punishment, free trade, protection,
etc.; and Mr. Greely grapples with the knottiest questions
which those themes suggest with a firm will, and an eager
intellect. Bating some doubtful opinions and some bad
rhetoric, the volume conveys a good impression of the
author’s many excellent qualities of mind and character.
We cannot better describe the object of his work than by
employing his own words. “It aspires,” he says, “to
be a mediator, an interpreter, a reconciler, between Conservatism
and Radicalism—to bring the two into such
connection and relation that the good in each may obey
the law of chemical affinity, and abandon whatever portion
of either is false, mistaken, or outworn to sink down
and perish. It endeavors so to elucidate and commend
what is just and practical in the pervading demands of our
time for a Social Renovation that the humane and philanthropic
can no longer misrepresent and malign them as
destructive, demoralizing or infidel in their tendencies, but
must joyfully recognize in them the fruits of past and the
seeds of future Progress in the history of our Race.”
The idea in this passage is one which a conservative of
the school of Burke would have no reason to disown. The
difficulty is in the different things meant by the two parties,
when they use the words “false, mistaken, and outworn.”
Time, and the course of things, not any particular intellect,
must settle the dispute; although we hope that Time, if
he can take “Hints,” will <a id='acce'></a>accelerate his pace a little, at
our author’s particular request.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
